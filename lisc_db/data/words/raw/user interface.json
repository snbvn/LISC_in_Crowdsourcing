Two authors (working independently) comprehensively reviewed six databases (PubMed, Cochrane database, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar) from their dates of inception until March 2020. Oral mucosal disorder, as detected by TB, was compared with that detected by chemiluminescence. True-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative data were extracted for each study. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (ver. 2). The extent of interrater agreement was also assessed. Twenty-nine prospective and retrospective studies were included. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of TB was 7.017 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.544; 10.836). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.766. The correlation between the sensitivity and the false-positive rate was 0.196, indicating the absence of heterogeneity. TB exhibited moderate interrater reliability (0.6777; 95% CI, 0.43; 0.7455). Compared with chemiluminescence, as used in nine studies, TB had a lower sensitivity (0.659 vs. 0.841), but a higher specificity (0.809 vs. 0.345), negative predictive value (0.766 vs. 0.690), and DOR (10.565 vs. 5.203). Compared with clinical examination, as used in four studies, TB method had a higher sensitivity (0.891 vs. 0.891), specificity (0.739 vs. 0.634), negative predictive value (0.920 vs. 0.714), and DOR (28.491 vs. 8.526). Subgroup analysis showed that screening for severe dysplasia or more severe disease was significantly more sensitive, but less specific, than screening for all dysplasias. Although the diagnostic accuracy of TB in the diagnostic work-up of oral cancer and precancer was higher than that of clinical examination, it was not high enough for TB to reliably be used alone. Instead, it should be combined with chemiluminescence or other diagnostic tools.", "keywords": ["luminescence", "mouth neoplasms", "precancerous conditions", "tolonium chloride"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/coa.13613"}

This study is a secondary data analysis of a longitudinal study for tracking the change of health status of older adults 60 years of age or older. Participants who had undergone at least two assessments during 2013-2017 were selected for analysis. Guided by the Gobben's Frailty Model, biopsychosocial predictors were comprehensively identified from the literature, and their relationship to frailty state transition was explored. We compared the baseline characteristics of participants at the frail, pre-frail, and robust states (categorized using the Fried Frailty Index). A generalized estimating equation was used to identify factors associated with an improvement or a deterioration in frailty. The probability of transitions between frailty states was calculated.

Reduction in sleep quality increases blood pressure (BP) and favors hypertension development. Previous studies suggested a relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and sleep quality, but it is unclear whether this association is present in hypertensives. Thus, this study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and cardiac autonomic modulation in hypertensives. Forty-seven middle-aged hypertensive men under consistent anti-hypertensive treatment were assessed for sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-higher score means worse sleep quality). Additionally, their beat-by-beat BP and heart rate (HR) were recorded, and cardiac autonomic modulation was assessed by their variabilities.

This report communicates the current limitations and best practice advice from early adopters to help guide those implementing DIR in the clinic at this early stage. They are based on the state of image registration applications in radiotherapy in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and consensus discussions made at the 'Deforming to Best Practice' workshops in 2018. The current status of clinical application use cases is presented, including multimodal imaging, automatic segmentation, adaptive radiotherapy, retreatment, dose accumulation and response assessment, along with uptake, accuracy and limitations. Key areas of concern and preliminary suggestions for commissioning, quality assurance, education and training, and the use of automation are also reported. Many questions remain, and the radiotherapy community will benefit from continued research in this area. However, DIR is available to clinics and this report is intended to aid departments using or about to use DIR tools now.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1002/jmrs.417"}

In this meta-analysis, the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for RCTs, which involve patients with T2DM reporting skin-related AEs. RCTs that comparatively evaluated the effects of DPP-4i treatment and placebo on patients with T2DM and reported skin-related AEs were included in the analysis. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the Peto's methods. The GRADE approach was used to rate the quality of evidence. 46 randomized placebo-controlled trials, including 3 trials with reports of BP (n=38,011), that reported skin-related AEs were included (n=59,332). Compared to the placebo group, the risk of developing BP was significantly higher in the DPP-4i treatment group (OR=7.38, 95% CI 2.00-27.25, I2 =0%, P=0.003; quality rating: very low). Additionally, DPP-4i treatment was associated with an increased overall risk of developing skin-related AEs (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.46, I2 =32%, P=0.03; quality rating: moderate). This meta-analysis suggested that treatment with DPP-4is, including sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin, was associated with an increased risk of developing BP. Additionally, the risk of developing skin-related AEs increased when all DPP-4is were combined. Skin lesion, especially BP, should be monitored in patients with diabetes undergoing DPP-4i treatment.

The current study presents an in-depth qualitative analysis of parental child- and self-oriented appraisals of injustice in the context of their child's chronic pain. Twenty-one mothers of children living with chronic pain participated in one of five focus group interviews conducted in Ghent (Belgium), Glasgow (Scotland) and Indianapolis (USA). The interviews were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis, which revealed three key justice-related themes, labelled 'You shouldn't be in this much pain', 'The problem's probably with the mother' and 'At least it's not cancer'. Maternal injustice appraisals focused mainly on the child rather than the self and reflected various perceived barriers to their efforts to provide quality of life for their child. A fourth theme labelled 'Not everybody gets a healthy child' reflected maternal strategies to effectively cope with the child's condition and the associated appraisals of injustice. The current findings attest to the relevance of (child- and self-oriented) injustice in the parental experience of caring for a child with chronic pain and provides insight into the specific content and scope of these appraisals.

Patients with nail involvement experience pain, functional impairment and social stigma, with significant restriction of daily activities and quality of life. Nail psoriasis is also considered a risk factor for the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Management of nail psoriasis is deemed challenging and as a result, it is often left untreated by physicians. Assessing the severity of nail disease can also be difficult in clinical practice. While the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index is used widely in trials, it is time-consuming and rarely used in the clinic, highlighting the need to develop a simplified disease severity score for nail psoriasis. All patients should be advised to keep their nails short, wear gloves for wet and dirty work, and regularly apply emollient to the nail folds and nail surface. Patients with mild nail psoriasis, without signs of severe cutaneous psoriasis or PsA, may benefit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail involvement. Evidence suggests that all anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, anti-interleukin (IL)-17, and anti-IL-12/23 antibodies available for plaque psoriasis and PsA are highly effective treatments for nail psoriasis.

Analysis of RNA-Sequencing outputs revealed 41 genes (34 protein-coding; 7 non-coding) that were significantly differentially expressed between MT and NT cases. The log2 fold change for the statistically significant differentially expressed genes ranged from -2.63 to 2.48, with 23 protein-coding genes being downregulated and 11 protein-coding genes being upregulated in MT cases compared to NT cases.

One newly implementation is to employ an energy-discriminating photon counting detector (PCD), which can distinguish photon energy and divide a whole X-ray spectrum into several energy bins with appropriate post-processing steps. The state-of-the-art PCD-based spectral CT has superior energy-resolution and material distinguishability, and it further has a great potential in both medical and industrial applications. To improve the reconstruction quality and decomposition accuracy, in this work, we propose an optimization-based spectral CT reconstruction method with an innovational sparsity constraint. We first employ a locally linear transform to the reconstructed channel images, and the structural similarity along the spectral dimension is effectively converted to a one-dimensional (1D) gradient sparsity. Then, combining the prior knowledge of piecewise constant in the spatial domain (e.g. a two-dimensional (2D) gradient sparsity feature), we unify both spectral and spatial dimensions and establish a joint three-dimensional (3D) gradient sparsity. In addition, we use the L0 -norm to measure the proposed sparsity and incorporate it as a smoothness constraint to concretize a general optimization framework. Furthermore, we develop the corresponding iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Both visual results and quantitative indexes of numerical simulations and phantom experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperform the conventional filtered backprojection (FBP), total variation (TV), 2D L0 -norm (L0 ), and TV with low rank (TVLR) based methods. From the image and ROI comparisons, we find the proposed method performs well in noise suppression, detail maintenance, and decomposition accuracy. However, the FBP suffers severe noise, the TV and L0 are difficult to work consistently among different energy bins, and the TVLR fails to avoid gray value shift. The image quality assessments, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), normal mean absolute deviation (NMAD) and structural similarity (SSIM), also consistently indicate the proposed method can effectively removing noise and keeping fine structures in both channel-wise reconstructions and material decompositions. By employing a locally linear transform, the structural similarity among spectral channel images is converted to a 1D gradient sparsity, and the gray value shift is effectively avoided when the difference measurement is minimized. The 3D L0 -norm jointly and uniformly measures the gradient sparsity in both spectral and spatial dimensions. The cooperation of locally linear transform and 3D L0 -norm well reinforces the global sparse features and keeps the correlation along spectral dimension without bringing gray-value distortions. The corresponding constraint optimization model is fast and stably solved by using an alternative direction technique. Both numerical simulations and phantom experiments confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in noise suppression, structure maintenance, and accurate decomposition.", "keywords": ["-norm minimization", "locally linear transform", "material decomposition", "spectral CT", "three-dimensional (3D) gradient sparsity"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1002/mp.14420"}

Here we present an alternative, analytical method to approximate moments, in particular expectation value and (co)variance, of the probability distribution of DVH-points, and evaluate its accuracy on patient data. We use Analytical Probabilistic Modeling (APM) to derive moments of the probability distribution over individual DVH-points based on the probability distribution over dose. By using the computed moments to parameterize distinct probability distributions over DVH-points (here normal or beta distributions), not only the moments but also percentiles, i. e., \u03b1-DVHs, are computed. The model is subsequently evaluated on three patient cases (intracranial, paraspinal, prostate) in 30- and singlefraction scenarios by assuming the dose to follow a multivariate normal distribution, whose moments are computed in closed-form with APM. The results are compared to a benchmark based on discrete random sampling. The evaluation of the new probabilistic model on the three patient cases against a sampling benchmark proves its correctness under perfect assumptions as well as good agreement in realistic conditions. More precisely, ca. 90% of all computed expected DVH-points and their standard deviations agree within 1% volume with their empirical counterpart from sampling computations, for both fractionated and single fraction treatments. When computing \u03b1-DVHs, the assumption of a beta distribution achieved better agreement with empirical percentiles than the assumption of a normal distribution: While in both cases probabilities locally showed large deviations (up to \u00b10.2), the respective \u03b1 -DVHs for \u03b1 = {0:05; 0:5; 0:95} only showed small deviations in respective volume (up to \u00b15% volume for a normal distribution, and up to 2% for a beta distribution). A previously published model from literature, which was included for comparison, exhibited substantially larger deviations. With APM we could derive a mathematically exact description of moments of probability distributions over DVH-points given a probability distribution over dose. The model generalizes previous attempts and performs well for both choices of probability distributions, i. e., normal or beta distributions, over DVH-points.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1002/mp.14414"}

People with a cancer diagnosis who did complete (completers, n\u2009=\u200911) and did not complete (non-completers, n\u2009=\u20094) a 12-session exercise program at a tertiary hospital were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematic analysis was employed to identify emergent themes. Perceived benefits of exercise was the most prominent theme to emerge, with most participants recognizing improvements in physical, mental, and/or social well-being. Non-completers focused on treatment-related side effects, whereas completers saw an opportunity to return to a healthy lifestyle. The transition from a supervised environment to everyday life presented as the most significant barrier to exercise beyond the program among both program completers and non-completers. Most people with cancer identified physical, mental, and social benefits from exercising. However, people with cancer and cancer survivors had difficulty maintaining exercise participation beyond completion of a supervised hospital-based program. Improving exercise participation in people with cancer and cancer survivors may require supervised exercise interventions plus the implementation of strategies to manage side effects and to facilitate the transition of exercise into everyday life to enhance long-term adherence.", "keywords": ["Adherence", "Barriers", "Benefits", "Cancer", "Exercise", "Qualitative study"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s00520-020-05647-y"}

To better inform health policies suited for the needs of international immigrants living in China, empirical evidence on the health service utilization of these international immigrants living in China is urgently needed. Our study included 5459 international immigrants including inpatients and outpatients, who were treated over a 4-year period (2015-2018) in one of the most frequented hospitals by international immigrants in Yiwu, Zhejiang province. Data (e.g., demographic information, outpatient costs, inpatient costs, length of stay, and the average number of visits per patient) were extracted from the Health Information System at the hospital. Descriptive analysis was performed to analyze the basic characteristics of international immigrants living in China (e.g., medical costs, length of stay and the average number of visits per patient) during the study period. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the factors that influence the health service utilization of international immigrants. International immigrants tended to use outpatient services (accounting for 97.22% of the whole sample) compared with inpatient services (only 2.78% of the whole sample). Most international immigrants visited the hospital because of orthopedics, otolaryngological diseases, pediatric-related diseases and skin-related diseases, followed by maternity and general surgery. The average number of visits to the outpatient department per patient was 2.1 in 2015 to 2.5 in 2018, and the length of stay increased from 3.45\u00a0days to 5.81\u00a0days during last four years. The outpatient costs increased from RMB 800.43(112.22 US$) to RMB 1756.98(246.33 US$), and inpatient costs rose from RMB 10,958.89(1536.44US$) to RMB 20,912.55(2931.94US$) during 2015-2018. The average number of visits and outpatient costs of international immigrants were both lower than those of local Chinese people (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistic difference in inpatient costs and LOS between international immigrants and Chinese. Having health insurance in China was significantly related with higher medical costs. Our results indicate that international immigrants living in China make greater use of outpatient services rather than hospitalization health services. Health services utilization is increasing in the last four years, but it was lower than that of local Chinese people especially outpatient service utilization. Moreover, more attention should be garnered toward specific health issues experienced by international immigrants, such as orthopedic health, maternal and child health, occupational diseases or accidents, and infectious diseases with skin-related symptoms. The policy implications from the results of this study are as follows. First, in order to improve international immigrants' health and access to health services in China, the government needs to pay more attention to incorporating international immigrants' health services to the current health system. Second, health policy is an important determining factor of access to health care, as policy can influence aspects of health services delivery such as the availability of resources, organization, and financing. Therefore, specific framework for the content of health policies focused on international immigrant populations should be developed.", "keywords": ["Health policy", "Health service utilization", "International immigrants"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s10903-020-01066-7"}

Active polymetallic industries and mines cause great continuous devastation of both terrestrial and aquatic environments on a local and regional scale. This study investigated the pollution of surface water and groundwater in the area containing six large-scale iron ore mines, which have been in operation for more than a few decades. In order to assess the PTEs pollution, the spatial and temporal distributions of 13 different PTEs (Al, As, Co, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Si, Sr, and Zn) were measured in 42 water samples collected from the multi-aquifer system including three distinct aquifers (upper alluvial aquifer (UAA), lower alluvial aquifer (LAA), and hard-rock aquifer (HRA)) of the Gohar-Zamin mining area in Iran. The highest concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS\u2009=\u2009164,000\u00a0mg/l) and PTEs were measured in HRA. Three trends were identified between the PTE concentration and increasing of TDS based on Spearman correlation analysis: (1) an increasing trend for Al, Co, Li, Mn, Rb, Se, Sr, and Ni; there were strong positive correlations in HRA between TDS and Mn (0.83), Al (0.65), Co (0.74), Li (0.90), Ni (0.83), Rb (0.91), Se (0.82), and Sr (0.84), suggesting a common origin for these elements; (2) no obvious trend for As and Mo, no correlation was founded between As and Mo with other PTEs and TDS, indicating a natural geogenic origin and mutual dependencies of these elements; and (3) a decreasing trend for Si, Zn, and Pb; TDS had a significantly negative correlation with the PTEs and attributing to different chemical properties of infiltrated groundwater. In the principal component analysis (PCA), the first PC that covers 85.09% of the total observed variance is mainly attributed the groundwater salinization. This component is composed of Al, Co, Li, Mn, Rb, Se, Sr, and Ni. The second PC contains elements As and Mo. This PC explain 14.4% of total variance and may be referred to natural origin of PTEs. Si, Zn, and Pb are in the third principal component and cover 9.64% of the variance of the data. Third PC have been attributed to lithogenic and/or primary water chemistry factors. The PTE pollution were evaluated based on heavy metal evaluation index (HEI), heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and degree of contamination (Cd). The results indicated that all of the groundwater samples collected from HRA had HEI, HPI, and Cd values greater than 21, 264, and 14 (highly pollution limits of indices), respectively, and were classified as highly polluted groundwater. HPI values within the UAA, LAA, and salt playa (SP) were lower than the critical level of 100, suggesting a threshold for the drinking water pollution. Moreover, HEI and Cd with values of less than 10 and 7 suggested low-level pollution in UAA, LAA, and SP. However, the contaminated level of PTEs exceeded the WHO standard for drinking water in HRA only. Since groundwater in HRA is a brine with the high values of PTEs, pumping of this water out to the surrounding natural environment may cause harmful impacts on the environment and perhaps living species in Bahram-e-Goor protected area.

As studies on the mandibular condyle bone are scarce, the aim of the present study was to assess its compositional characteristics in T2DM and RYGB conditions. Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice at 8\u00a0weeks of age were randomly assigned to receive either a high-fat or low-fat diet. After 14\u00a0weeks of high-fat diet intake, seven obese mice were subjected to RYGB surgery. All animals were euthanized at the age of 30\u00a0weeks. Mandibular bones were removed and the trabecular condyle region was assessed using Raman spectroscopy. A decreased mineralization was observed for both T2DM and RYGB condyle bones when compared to controls, with elevated carbonate substitutions for the RYGB group. No compositional differences in crystallinity and presence of advanced glycation end products were found between the groups, with the exception of an increased presence of N-carboxymethyl-lysine in RYGB bone compared to their T2DM counterpart. Site-specific measurements revealed a non-uniform bone composition, with increasing mineralization and carbonate substitutions towards the centre of the mandibular condyle. T2DM and RYGB surgery affect the mandibular condyle bone quality, as investigated at compositional level.

The input from these participants was included through a combination of the Delphi and MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical-Based Evaluation Technique) methods, which were applied to an index developed using fuzzy logic. The index was then validated by conducting sensitivity and comparative analyses on a database from field sampling campaigns conducted in various small municipal DSs in two Canadian provinces: Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. Finally, the drinking water quality index was applied to a database of the DS in Quebec City, Canada. Sensitivity and comparative analyses revealed that the developed index could allow for the characterization of water sample quality and could prove useful for prioritizing interventions in the DS. The index was also useful for representing the spatial variability of water quality, and provided nuanced information about water quality, especially when the water quality parameter values complied with guidelines and regulations.

This study included patients for whom a computed tomographic scan was indicated following craniomaxillofacial fracture repair at a Level I trauma center. Postoperative craniomaxillofacial computed tomography was performed using a low-dose protocol, rather than standard protocols. A craniomaxillofacial surgeon and a radiologist interpreted the images to determine whether they were of sufficient quality. It was decided a priori that any inadequate low-dose computed tomography would require repeated scanning using standard protocols. The primary endpoint was the need for repeated computed tomography. In addition, the clarity of clinically significant anatomical landmarks on the images was graded on a five-point Likert scale. Twenty patients were scanned postoperatively using the low-dose protocol. Mean radiation dose (total dose-length product) from the low-dose protocol was 71 mGy \u00b7 cm versus 532 mGy \u00b7 cm for the preoperative computed tomographic scans that were obtained using conventional protocols (p < 0.001). All 20 low-dose computed tomographic scans were determined to provide satisfactory image quality. No patients required repeated computed tomography secondary to poor image quality. Low-dose computed tomography received high image-quality scores. A low-dose computed tomography protocol that delivers approximately 7.5-fold less radiation than the standard protocols was found to be adequate for postoperative evaluation of craniomaxillofacial fractures.

Diabetics and women have increased odds of having surgery without a prior steroid injection, despite similar success rates of steroid injections compared to nondiabetics and men.

In total, 762 women (aged 45-54 y, 459 premenopausal, and 303 perimenopausal) from the Midlife Women's Health Study answered self-reported questions regarding the frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. Serum E2, progesterone, testosterone, serum hormone binding globulin, free E2 index, free testosterone index, E2:progesterone, and E2:testosterone were measured. Summary measures of phthalate mixtures, including the phthalates from plastic sources (sumPLASTIC), personal care products (sumPCP), di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (sumDEHP), anti-androgenic phthalates (sumAA), and all phthalate metabolites measured (sumALL), were calculated from urinary phthalate metabolites. Ordinal logistic regression was used to fit each outcome sleep measure with all hormones and summary phthalates. Progesterone and testosterone were significantly negatively associated with the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia. Free testosterone index was also negatively associated with insomnia frequency. E2:progesterone was positively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances and restless sleep in self-reported nonsmokers. SumPCP and sumALL were significantly negatively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep.

Studies in healthy women showed an association between verbal memory performance and physiologic VMS measured with ambulatory skin conductance monitors but not with VMS by self-report. We hypothesized that we would find a similar association in women with breast cancer. Participants included 30 female breast cancer survivors (mean age 52.7 y; 26.7% African-American) with moderate-to-severe VMS enrolled in a larger clinical trial of a nonhormonal intervention for VMS. At baseline, participants completed assessments of physiologic VMS, actigraphy-based assessments of sleep, questionnaires about mood, and two tests of verbal memory - Logical Memory (LM) and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Using baseline data, we conducted multivariate regression analyses to examine the association between VMS and memory, controlling for sleep and other factors. On average, women reported 46% of total physiologic VMS. A higher frequency of physiologic VMS - but not reported VMS - was significantly associated with lower scores on the California Verbal Learning Test short-delay free recall (r[28]\u200a=\u200a-0.41, P\u200a=\u200a0.03), long-delay free recall (r[28]\u200a=\u200a-0.42, P\u200a=\u200a0.03), and total clustering, (r[28]\u200a=\u200a-0.39, P\u200a=\u200a0.04).

A myriad of impactful ML applications already exists in orthopaedics ranging from predicting infections after surgery to diagnostic imaging. However, no systematic reviews that we know of have compared, in particular, the performance of ML models with that of clinicians in musculoskeletal imaging to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of applying ML to imaging diagnoses. By doing so, this review delves into where current ML developments stand in aiding orthopaedists in assessing musculoskeletal images. This systematic review aimed (1) to compare performance of ML models versus clinicians in detecting, differentiating, or classifying orthopaedic abnormalities on imaging by (A) accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, (B) input features (for example, plain radiographs, MRI scans, ultrasound), (C) clinician specialties, and (2) to compare the performance of clinician-aided versus unaided ML models. A systematic review was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to October 1, 2019, using synonyms for machine learning and all potential orthopaedic specialties. We included all studies that compared ML models head-to-head against clinicians in the binary detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal images. After screening 6531 studies, we ultimately included 12 studies. We conducted quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist. All 12 studies were of comparable quality, and they all clearly included six of the eight critical appraisal items (study aim, input feature, ground truth, ML versus human comparison, performance metric, and ML model description). This justified summarizing the findings in a quantitative form by calculating the median absolute improvement of the ML models compared with clinicians for the following metrics of performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. ML models provided, in aggregate, only very slight improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with clinicians working alone and were on par in specificity (3% (interquartile range [IQR] -2.0% to 7.5%), 0.06% (IQR -0.03 to 0.14), and 0.00 (IQR -0.048 to 0.048), respectively). Inputs used by the ML models were plain radiographs (n = 8), MRI scans (n = 3), and ultrasound examinations (n = 1). Overall, ML models outperformed clinicians more when interpreting plain radiographs than when interpreting MRIs (17 of 34 and 3 of 16 performance comparisons, respectively). Orthopaedists and radiologists performed similarly to ML models, while ML models mostly outperformed other clinicians (outperformance in 7 of 19, 7 of 23, and 6 of 10 performance comparisons, respectively). Two studies evaluated the performance of clinicians aided and unaided by ML models; both demonstrated considerable improvements in ML-aided clinician performance by reporting a 47% decrease of misinterpretation rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 54; p < 0.001) and a mean increase in specificity of 0.048 (95% CI 0.029 to 0.068; p < 0.001) in detecting abnormalities on musculoskeletal images. At present, ML models have comparable performance to clinicians in assessing musculoskeletal images. ML models may enhance the performance of clinicians as a technical supplement rather than as a replacement for clinical intelligence. Future ML-related studies should emphasize how ML models can complement clinicians, instead of determining the overall superiority of one versus the other. This can be accomplished by improving transparent reporting, diminishing bias, determining the feasibility of implantation in the clinical setting, and appropriately tempering conclusions.

Between January 2016 and May 2017, 125 patients with end-stage lung emphysema undergoing LVRS were prospectively enrolled into this study. Patients with severe hypercapnia caused by chronic respiratory failure were bridged to or through LVRS with low-flow VV ECLS (65 patients, group 1). Patients with preoperative normocapnia served as a control group (60 patients, group 2). In group 1, VV ECLS was implemented preoperatively in five patients and in 60 patients intraoperatively. Extracorporeal lung support was continued postoperatively in all 65 patients. Mean length of postoperative VV ECLS support was 3 \u00b1 1 day. The 90 day mortality rate was 7.8% in group 1 compared with 5% in group 2 (p = 0.5). Postoperatively, a significant improvement was observed in quality of life, exercise capacity, and dyspnea symptoms in both groups. VV ECLS in patients with severe hypercapnia undergoing LVRS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option. In particular, it increases the intraoperative safety, supports de-escalation of ventilatory strategies, and reduces the rate of postoperative complications in a cohort of patients considered \"high risk\" for LVRS in the current literature.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/MAT.0000000000001108"}

The severity of breathlessness depends on a complex combination of negative cardiopulmonary interactions and increased afferent stimulation from systemic sources. We review recent data exposing the seeds and consequences of these abnormalities in combined heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The drive to breathe increases ('excessive breathing') secondary to an enlarged dead space and hypoxemia (largely COPD-related) and heightened afferent stimuli, for example, sympathetic overexcitation, muscle ergorreceptor activation, and anaerobic metabolism (largely heart failure-related). Increased ventilatory drive might not be fully translated into the expected lung-chest wall displacement because of the mechanical derangements brought by COPD ('inappropriate breathing'). The latter abnormalities, in turn, negatively affect the central hemodynamics which are already compromised by heart failure. Physical activity then decreases, worsening muscle atrophy and dysfunction. Beyond the imperative of optimal pharmacological treatment of each disease, strategies to lessen ventilation (e.g., walking aids, oxygen, opiates and anxiolytics, and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation) and improve mechanics (heliox, noninvasive ventilation, and inspiratory muscle training) might mitigate the burden of this devastating symptom in advanced heart failure-COPD.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/SPC.0000000000000516"}

Historically, acute appendicitis was treated with emergency appendectomy. More recently, practice patterns have shifted to urgent appendectomy, with acceptable in-hospital delays of up to 24\u200ahours. However, the consequences of prolonged TTA remain poorly understood. Herein, we present the largest individual analysis to date of outcomes associated with prolonged in-hospital delay before appendectomy in children. Data from patients who underwent appendectomy within 24\u200ahours of hospital presentation were obtained from the American College of Surgeons Pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Procedure Targeted Appendectomy database from 2016 to 2018. Appendectomy within 16\u200ahours of presentation was considered early, whereas those between 16 to 24\u200ahours were defined as late. The primary outcome was operative findings of complicated appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included 30-day complications and resource utilization. This study consisted of 18,927 patients, with 20.6% undergoing late appendectomy. The rate of complicated appendicitis was significantly higher in the late group (Early: 26.3%, Late: 30.3%, P < 0.05). Additionally, the late group had longer operative times, increased need for postoperative percutaneous drainage, antibiotics at discharge, parenteral nutrition, and an extended hospital length of stay (P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, late appendectomy remained a predictor of complicated disease (odds ratio 1.17 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.27]). A significant proportion of pediatric patients with acute appendicitis experience prolonged in-hospital delays before appendectomy, which are associated with modestly increased rates of complicated appendicitis. Although this does not indicate appendectomy needs to be done emergently, prolonged in-hospital TTA should be avoided whenever possible.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/SLA.0000000000004316"}

This study aimed to summarize and describe the effectiveness and characteristics of dressings and securement devices for catheter stabilization. A systematic review of literature from the following databases was conducted: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and OvidSP. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to guide article selection and reporting. Herein 626 articles were referred, with 5 directly related to the topic under discussion. We found 3 studies that describe PAC failure and 4 about dislodgement. We described 6 types of dressings or securement devices and classified them into 3 categories for classifying PAC dressings or securement devices. These were detected and grouped as adhesive tissues, sutureless devices, and transparent polyurethane dressings. Current research indicates that transparent polyurethane dressings offer the most effective catheter stabilization, but adhesive tissues may constitute a valid alternative. However, there are limited high-quality studies about effective dressings and securement devices for PACs.", "keywords": [], "year": null, "doi": "10.1097/DCC.0000000000000433"}

Withdrawal Assessment Scores were used to assess and manage iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms. Data related to opioid and sedation use, pain and sedation scores, and the occurrence and management of iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms were reviewed on 1,243 patients during four separate time periods: one pre-implementation and three discontinuous post-implementation time intervals. Patient age and complexity were consistent across the data collection periods. Post-implementation opioids and benzodiazepines use was reduced about 50% without a concomitant increase in the use of other sedative classes. Few post-intervention patients were discharged from the pediatric cardiac ICU or to home on methadone (pediatric cardiac ICU: pre 19% to post 3%; hospital: pre 12% to post 1.3%). Documentation of pain, sedation, and withdrawal scores became more consistent and nurses reported satisfaction with their patient's comfort management. The implementation of a nurse-driven goal-directed plan such as cardiac-RESTORE to manage pediatric cardiac ICU patient pain and sedation is possible, sustainable, and associated with reduced sedative and methadone use.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/PCC.0000000000002505"}

Authors searched five electronic bases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science) till December 2019. The search was conducted using key search terms and qualitative and mixed-method studies were included. Two independent reviewers screened articles and conducted quality appraisal. Data were synthesised thematically. A total of 11 articles that reported users' views on FIT kits were included. Three themes were generated from the included articles: FIT kit factors, patients' perception of colorectal cancer screening, and social health support system. The nature of the test and the supplementary information was found to affect the utilisation of the test. User's awareness and perspectives towards cancer and screening were found to have impacted the adoption of the FIT kit. Social support and local healthcare systems were also found to have influenced the use of FIT. This systematic review focuses on addressing and understanding the perception of FIT from first-hand accounts. Since its inception, FIT screening has increased colorectal cancer screening uptake due to its increased reliability and the simplicity of the test. However, there is a need to increase the uptake of FIT kits through increasing accessibility of the screening process and considering the holistic patient experience.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000607"}

However, there are persisting and substantial differences in mortality, incidence, and survival worldwide. In order to provide an up-to-date overview of trends in mortality, incidence, and survival, we retrieved data from high-quality, population-based cancer registries for all cancers and 10 selected cancer sites in six high-income countries and the European Union. We computed age-standardized (world standard population) mortality and incidence rates, and applied joinpoint regression models. Mortality from all cancers and most common cancer sites has declined over the last 25\u2009years, except for the pancreas and lung (in women). The patterns for incidence are less consistent between countries, except for a steady decrease in stomach cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in men. Survival for all cancers and the selected cancer sites increased in all countries, even if there is still a substantial variability. Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates have been levelling off among men and have been moderately increasing among women. These trends reflect changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are diagnosed early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to focus efforts to decrease the cancer burden and regularly monitor progress towards cancer control goals.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000594"}

In a randomized trial in patients on hemodialysis, there was no significant difference in vascular calcification between patients who received rivaroxaban with or without vitamin K2 or vitamin K antagonists. A randomized trial of apixaban versus warfarin was terminated owing to poor enrollment and preliminary results identified no difference in clinical outcomes between groups. However, valuable pharmacodynamic data will be forthcoming from that trial. In observational research, among patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, there were opposing trends in the associations of apixaban initiation versus no oral anticoagulation with ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke and no association was present with the overall risk of stroke or embolism. In another study comparing apixaban with warfarin initiation, apixaban was associated with less bleeding. Regular-dose apixaban (5\u200amg twice daily) associated with reduced rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, whereas no such association was present for those prescribed the reduced dose (2.5\u200amg twice daily).

The never expanded even in the original trial, which reported effective symptomatic relief with difelikefalin, has bolstered support for the role of an imbalance of \u03bc and \u03ba-opioid receptor activity in pruritogenesis. The role of a chronic inflammatory state increased cytokine levels and altered immune signaling in pruritogenic nerve activation continues to be elucidated with basic science, which paves the wave for future novel therapeutics.

Uremic pruritus remains a top research priority. Patients with uremic pruritus may be able to look forward to a new decade of understanding, knowledge, and novel treatment options for this burdensome condition.

This was a cross-case analysis study in 25 diverse U.S. PCMHs. Data sources included interviews of a clinician and an administrator in each PCMH, surveys of clinicians and staff, and existing data on the PCMHs' characteristics. We used coincidence analysis, a novel method based on set theory and Boolean logic, to evaluate relationships between factors and the implementation outcome of patient safety culture. The coincidence analysis identified 5 equally parsimonious solutions (4 factors), accounting for all practices with higher safety culture. Three solutions contained the same core minimally sufficient condition: the implementation factor leadership priority for patient safety and the social network factor reciprocity in advice-seeking network ties (advice-seeking relationships). This minimally sufficient condition had the highest coverage (5/7 practices scoring higher on the outcome) and best performance across solutions; all included leadership priority for patient safety. Other key factors included self-efficacy and job satisfaction and quality improvement climate. The most common factor whose absence was associated with the outcome was a well-functioning process for behavioral health. Our findings suggest that PCMH safety culture is higher when clinicians and staff perceive that leadership prioritizes patient safety and when high reciprocity among staff exists.
