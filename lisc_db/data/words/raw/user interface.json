The main outcome measure was post-haemorrhoidectomy pain scores over twenty-one days, measured on a ten-point Likert scale. There were no significant differences between groups with regards to age, gender, smoking status, self-reported general health or quality of life, haemorrhoid-related pain, haemorrhoid-related impact on quality of life, reported satisfaction with surgery, experience of surgery, median overall pain score, or likelihood of recommending surgery to others. For reported median worst pain scores and defaecation-related pain, a trend to significance was identified between groups on days 16 and 18-21 with the metronidazole group reporting less pain. However, these differences were not significant when pre-specified Bonferroni correction criteria were used. Using multilevel mixed effects modelling, the impact of time on median worst pain score was identified to be highly significant (p<0.0001) whereas treatment allocation (placebo versus metronidazole) did not significantly affect the improvement in patients' reported pain (p=0.8837). Our data do not support the hypothesis that post-operative metronidazole has a clinically meaningful effect on post-haemorrhoidectomy pain. This study adds to the previous literature, and implies that it should not be routinely used as an analgesic adjunct.", "keywords": ["Haemorrhoidectomy", "metronidazole", "pain"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/codi.15291"}

Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Notable benefits have included robust clinical volumes despite social distancing mandates, reduced logistical barrieres to care for many patients, and decreased no-show rates. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.", "keywords": ["Coronavirus/COVID-19", "Mental health care/service delivery systems", "Outpatient psychiatry", "Quality improvement", "Telepsychiatry"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002"}

We aimed to clarify whether compound events of extreme weather cause larger impacts on mortality than do each type of extreme if evaluated individually. Using daily data from the E-OBS and ERA5 datasets, we analyzed 9 types of extreme events: extreme wind gust, precipitation, snowfall, and sudden temperature and pressure changes. Relative mortality deviations from the adjusted baseline were used to estimate the immediate effect of the selected extreme events on excess mortality. The impact was adjusted for the effect of extreme cold. Extreme events associated with sudden rise of minimum temperature and pressure drops had generally significant impact on excess mortality (3.7% and 1.4% increase). The impacts were even more pronounced if these events occurred simultaneously or were compounded with other types of extremes, such as heavy precipitation, snowfall, maximum temperature rise, and their combinations (increase as great as 14.4%). Effects of some compound events were significant even for combinations of extremes having no significant impact on mortality when evaluated separately. On the other hand, a \"protective\" effect of pressure increases reduced the risk for its compound events. Meteorological patterns during extreme events linked to excess mortality indicate passage of a low-pressure system northerly from the study domain. We identified extreme winter weather events other than cold temperatures with significant impact on excess mortality. Our results suggest that occurrence of compound extreme events strengthen the impacts on mortality and therefore analysis of multiple meteorological parameters is a useful approach in defining adverse weather conditions.", "keywords": ["Central Europe", "Compound event", "Extreme winter weather", "Mortality", "Sudden change"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141033"}

Thus, a proper pretreatment is necessary to mitigate NDMA formation upon periodic chloramination by removing precursors, such as ranitidine (RNT). This study investigated the effect of UV/sulfite pretreatment on NDMA formation from an RNT-spiked tap and chloraminated synthetic swimming pool (SSP) water. At UVC intensity of 2.1 mW cm-2 and 0.5 mM of sulfite, UV/sulfite chemistry showed complete degradation of 20 \u00b5M RNT within 30 min. It was found that SO4\u2022- primarily reduced the NDMA formation potential (FP) of RNT, while hydrated electrons effectively mitigated the pre-formed NDMA in the SSP water. The UV/sulfite pretreatment alleviated NDMA formation during post-chloramination (24 h) by up to 82%, outperforming the commonly employed advanced oxidation processes such as UV/H2O2. However, in the presence of bromide ions, the effectiveness of UV/sulfite pretreatment was seriously deteriorated, although the bromide ion itself was found to inhibit the NDMA formation from RNT especially at pH < 8 during chloramination. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the NDMA-FP of RNT could be removed by UV/sulfite principally via N-methylation, dealkylation, and oxygen transfer pathways. Consequently, UV/sulfite could be used as an alternative unit process for water treatment with reduced NDMA formation.", "keywords": ["Bromide", "Chloraminated water", "N-nitrosodimethylamine", "Ranitidine", "UV/sulfite"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2020.116243"}

The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys are modern assessments of hospitals and providers of delivery of care. To report inpatient satisfaction according to HCAHPS and CG-CAHPS scores after shoulder arthroplasty, determine factors that influence them, and their correlation with surgical expectations, pain perception, quality of life, surgical setting, and functional outcomes. All patients scheduled for a shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively asked to complete a demographic and initial shoulder assessment form, a shoulder surgery expectations survey (SSES), a pain catastrophizing scale (PCS), a short form-12 (SF-12), and a resiliency form (RS-11). Patient satisfaction was measured with the Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG-CAHPS) and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) surveys. Legacy forms, patient-specific factors, type of surgery performed, location of surgery, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition were evaluated on their ability to predict these survey scores. Linear regression was used to calculate correlations and predictions of continuous variables and logistic regression was used for satisfied versus unsatisfied cohorts. The average HCAHPS and CG-CAHPS satisfaction scores for the population were 74.7 \u00b1 20.7 and 82.1 \u00b1 19.4. Non-smokers had a mean HCAHPS score of 77.7 \u00b1 22.0 and current smokers reported a mean of 59.6 \u00b1 5.2 (p = 0.03). Patients that were discharged home had a mean HCAHPS score of 77.3 \u00b1 21.9 where those discharged to a skilled-nursing facility (SNF) reported a mean of 59.3 \u00b1 6.6 (p = 0.05). These same groups also had significantly higher odds of being satisfied with the hospital. There were no significant differences or higher odds seen when comparing overall CG-CAHPS satisfaction between any of the patient-specific factors tested. There was no significant correlation between age, length of stay, pain (PCS), resiliency (RS-11), expectations (SSES), and function (SF-12) for both HCAHPS and CG-CAHPS satisfaction scores. Overall, 37 (74%) and 34 (68%) patients, respectively, had CG-CAHPS and HCAHPS scores that indicated satisfaction. Non-smokers and patients discharged home after surgery report higher levels of inpatient hospital (HCAHPS) satisfaction after shoulder arthroplasty. Patients with high preoperative surgical expectations, pain perception, and resiliency are not generally more satisfied with the hospital or clinician. Preoperative diagnosis, location of surgery, and length of stay does not reliably impact satisfaction with the hospital or clinician. HCAHPS and CG-CAHPS inpatient satisfaction does not correlate with legacy functional outcome measures, therefore, may not be predictive of long-term functional outcomes.

We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old male presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and \"pricking\" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator (IPG), a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life.

The data analysis demonstrated that compared with CPT, IMT+CPT significantly reduced the weaning duration (mean difference; 95% confidence interval) (-2.60; -4.76 to -0.45) and EM significantly reduced the MV duration (-2.01; -3.81 to -0.22). IMT + CPT and EM had the highest effectiveness in reducing the weaning duration and MV duration, respectively. IMT or EM should be recommended for improving the weaning outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients.

Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which has been reported to exert beneficial effects on DOX-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. This study was designed to investigate whether RvE1 protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and the underlying mechanism was explored. DOX (20 mg/kg, one injection, i.p.) was used to induce DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice. At 5 days after DOX administration, the effect of RvE1 was assessed by measuring cardiac function, oxidative stress, autophagy and apoptosis in cardiac tissue. We used an AKT inhibitor and rapamycin to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that RvE1 inhibited the DOX-induced decrease in body weight and heart weight, the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and the increase in lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase myocardial bound and cardiomyocyte vacuolization. Compared to the control group, the DOX group exhibited increased oxidative stress, autophagy and apoptosis in cardiac tissue, which were alleviated by treatment with RvE1. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were responsible for RvE1-mediated regulation of DOX-induced oxidative stress, autophagy and myocardial apoptosis. In conclusion, RvE1 protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via the regulation of AKT/mTOR signaling.", "keywords": ["AKT/mTOR signaling", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity", "Oxidative stress", "Resolvin E1"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114188"}

One of the mechanisms of airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) amid humans is through direct ejection of droplets via sneezing, coughing and vocalizing. Nevertheless, there are ample evidences of the persistence of infectious viruses on inanimate surfaces for several hours to a few days. Through a critical review of the current literature and a preliminary analysis of the link between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and air pollution in the affected regions, we offer a perspective that polluted environment could enhance the transmission rate of such deadly viruses under moderate-to-high humidity conditions. The aqueous atmospheric aerosols offer a conducive surface for adsorption/absorption of organic molecules and viruses onto them, facilitating a pathway for higher rate of transmission under favourable environmental conditions. This mechanism partially explains the role of polluted air besides the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases in the rapid transmission of the virus amongst the public. Hence, it is stressed that more ambitious policies towards a cleaner environment are required globally to nip in the bud what could be the seeds of a fatal outbreak such as COVID-19.", "keywords": ["Air pollution", "Corona virus", "adsorption", "meteorological parameters", "pandemic"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.envres.2020.110001"}

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is currently projected to affect 4.4% of the global population by 2030. Diabetes has been associated with poor outcomes for a variety of surgical interventions. However, the impact of insulin dependence has yet to be fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of insulin dependence on acute postoperative complications following rTHA. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program database. All patients who underwent rTHA between 2006 and 2016 were identified and recorded as having non-insulin-dependent DM (NIDDM), insulin-dependent DM (IDDM) or no DM. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the incidence of multiple adverse events within 30\u2009days after rTHA. A total of 7685 patients were evaluated (No DM\u2009=\u20096651, NIDDM\u2009=\u2009700, IDDM\u2009=\u2009334). Univariate analysis revealed that all patients with DM had significantly higher incidences of postoperative complications (NIDDM: p\u2009<\u20090.001; IDDM: p\u2009<\u20090.001) and extended hospital length of stay (NIDDM: p\u2009=\u20090.015; IDDM: p\u2009<\u20090.0001). NIDDM was associated with increased rates of superficial surgical site infection (SSI) (p\u2009=\u20090.001), deep SSI (p\u2009=\u20090.038), and stroke (p\u2009=\u20090.013), while IDDM was associated with increased rates of pneumonia (p\u2009<\u20090.001), renal failure (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and postoperative transfusion (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Currently, there is no clear consensus on how to define the stages of Parkinson's disease; the proportion of Parkinson's patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the referral process, and the clinical features used to characterize advanced Parkinson's disease are not well delineated. The primary objective of this observational study was to evaluate the proportion of Parkinson's patients identified as advanced patients according to physician's judgment in all participating movement disorder centers across the study. Here we evaluate the Hungarian subset of the participating patients. The study was conducted in a cross-sectional, non-interventional, multi-country, multi-center format in 18 countries. Data were collected during a single patient visit. Current Parkinson's disease status was assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts II, III, IV, and V (modified Hoehn and Yahr staging). Non-motor symptoms were assessed using the PD Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS); quality of life was assessed with the PD 8-item Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Parkinson's disease was classified as advanced versus non-advanced based on physician assessment and on questions developed by the Delphi method. Overall, 2627 patients with Parkinson's disease from 126 sites were documented. In Hungary, 100 patients with Parkinson's disease were documented in four movement disorder centers, and, according to the physician assessment, 50% of these patients had advanced Parkinson's disease. Their mean scores showed significantly higher impairment in those with, versus without advanced Parkinson's disease: UPDRS II (14.1 vs. 9.2), UPDRS IV Q32 (1.1 vs. 0.0) and Q39 (1.1 vs. 0.5), UPDRS V (2.8 vs. 2.0) and PDQ-8 (29.1 vs. 18.9). Physicians in Hungarian movement disorder centers assessed that half of the Parkinson's patients had advanced disease, with worse motor and non-motor symptom severity and worse QoL than those without advanced Parkinson's disease. Despite being classified as eligible for invasive/device-aided treatment, that treatment had not been initiated in 25% of these patients.

This can be a problematic presentation in the emergency department, both from a diagnostic and a management standpoint. Purpose - The aim of our study is to clarify what happens to patients after leaving the emergency department. Methods - 879 patients were examined at the Semmel-weis University Emergency Department with vertigo and dizziness. We sent a questionnaire to these patients and we had 308 completed papers back (110 male, 198 female patients, mean age 61.8 \u00b1 12.31 SD), which we further analyzed. Results - Based on the emergency department diagnosis we had the following results: central vestibular lesion (n = 71), dizziness or giddiness (n = 64) and BPPV (n = 51) were among the most frequent diagnosis. Clarification of the final post-examination diagnosis took several days (28.8%), and weeks (24.2%). It was also noticed that 24.02% of this population never received a proper diagnosis. Among the population only 80 patients (25.8%) got proper diagnosis of their complaints, which was supported by qualitative statistical analysis (Cohen Kappa test) result (\u03ba = 0.560). Discussion - The correlation between our emergency department diagnosis and final diagnosis given to patients is low, a phenomenon that is also observable in other countries. Therefore, patient follow-up is an important issue, including the importance of neurotology and possibly neurological examination. Conclusion - Emergency diagnosis of vertigo is a great challenge, but despite of difficulties the targeted and quick case history and exact examination can evaluate the central or peripheral cause of the balance disorder. Therefore, to prevent declination of the quality of life the importance of further investigation is high.

Spectra Optia apheresis technology was used. For 23 patients, a single apheresis sufficed to generate enough cells and manufacture CAR-T-cells, the remainder required two aphereses to meet target dose and/or two apheresis series because of production failure. Aphereses were technically feasible and clinically tolerable without serious adverse effects. The median collection efficiencies for MNC and T-cells were 53% and 56%, respectively. In summary, CAR apheresis in pediatric patients, including the very young, is feasible, safe and efficient, but the specified cell dose targets can be challenging in smaller children.

This was compared two alternative strategies; (1) general prison population screening and treatment and (2) prioritising screening and treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID) combined with general prison population screening and treatment. Strategies varied the rates of screening (47-90%), linkage-to-care (60-86%) and treatment (21-85%). Cost, utility and disease transition rates were obtained from existing literature. Outcome measures were; screening, treatment and disease-related costs per admitted individual, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each intervention. All costs and utilities were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum. Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses have been conducted. In our cohort of 5,239 incarcerated individuals with an estimated chronic HCV prevalence of 2.6%, all strategy ICER values (\u00a33,565-10,300) fell below the national willingness to pay threshold (\u00a330,000). Increased successful treatment (7-54%) was observed by an optimising cascade-of-care. A robust sensitivity analysis identified treatment cost of, QALY for mild liver disease and probability of completing treatment as important factors that impact the ICER value. In our remand setting, optimising adherence to the cascade-of-care is cost-effective. Where universal screening is not practical, a stratified approach focused on intensive screening and treatment of PWID also results in increased treatment uptake and is highly cost-effective.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/liv.14628"}

The phantoms are imaged in an x-ray imaging system using different beam qualities and different entrance air KERMA. Methods, previously developed for synthetic images and simulations, are adapted to real measurements, solving practical implementation issues. In the case of the star-bar, in order to obtain optimal MTF determinations it is necessary to accurately determine the center of the pattern. Also, to avoid underestimates in MTF calculations, the length in pixels of each of the scanning circumferences must be an integer multiple of the number of cycles in the pattern. Both methods, star-bar and edge, give similar mean values of the MTF in all cases analyzed. Also, the dependence with frequency of the experimental MTF standard deviation (SD) agrees with the theoretical expressions presented in previous works. In this regard, the precision is better for the star-bar method than for the edge and differences in precision between both methods are higher for the lowest beam quality. The star-bar phantom can be used for MTF determinations with the advantage of having an improved precision. However, precision is reduced when the radiation quality increases. This fact suggests that, for the highest beam qualities, materials with an attenuation coefficient greater than that of steel should be used to manufacture the phantom.", "keywords": ["MTF", "edge phantom", "star-bar phantom", "uncertainties"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1002/mp.14426"}

The implementation study design consisted of 2 nonrandomized independent groups (usual care and high intensity) that were staged within a single SNF.

Physical therapists administered the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and gait speed at evaluation and discharge. RE-AIM was used to evaluate the implementation process. An observational checklist and documentation audits were used to assess treatment fidelity. Regression analyses evaluated the response of functional change by group. No treatment-specific adverse events were reported. Treatment fidelity was high at >\u200999%, whereas documentation varied from 21% to 50%. Patient satisfaction was greater in i-STRONGER, and patient refusals to participate in therapy sessions trended downward in i-STRONGER. Patients in i-STRONGER exhibited a 0.13\u00a0m/s greater change in gait speed than in the usual care group.

The findings from this study indicate that implementation of a high-intensity resistance training framework in SNFs is safe and feasible. Furthermore, results support a signal effectiveness of improving function and satisfaction, although the heterogeneity of the population necessitates a larger implementation study to confirm. This pragmatic study demonstrates that high intensity resistance training in medically complex older adults is safe and favorable in SNFs.

For this systematic review, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase (OVID), PEDro, SciELO, and CINAHL were searched from inception to November 2019. Included studies were randomized clinical trials in which people with stable COPD were allocated (1) to an experimental group that received lower-limb resistance training, upper-limb resistance training, or both using elastic resistance or (2) to a control group that received no or sham resistance training or conventional resistance training using weight machines. Data extraction was performed by 3 review authors. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro scale. Eight studies on 332 participants were included. Knee extensor strength was higher in the experimental group (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.09-0.95) compared with the nonexercise control group. Compared to the conventional exercise control, the experimental group presented similar effects for muscle strength, functional exercise capacity, HRQoL and dyspnea (95% CI overlapped the line of no effect for all). Elastic resistance training improves muscle strength in people with COPD. The current review suggests elastic resistance as a potential alternative to conventional resistance training using weight machines, as they show similar effects on muscle strength, functional exercise capacity, HRQoL, and dyspnea. Due to its beneficial effects, including reduced risk of exacerbation-related hospitalizations, exercise training is viewed as the cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD. This study shows that elastic resistance training can be an effective, portable, practical, and low-cost alternative to conventional weight resistance training. Lay summary. Training with elastic resistance tubes or bands-which are easy to carry, easy to use, and relatively low cost-can be an effective way to improve strength for people with COPD and promote similar benefits to those achieved with weight machines.", "keywords": ["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease", "Exercise", "Muscle Strength", "Rehabilitation"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1093/ptj/pzaa149"}

The need for 'culturally competent' healthcare systems that can adapt and respond to the needs of a changing population while taking into account cultural, religious, linguistic and gender diversity, has become more and more an agenda across Europe. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that inequalities in health conditions are mainly due to socio-economic factors, and disparities are particularly evident among certain ethnic and cultural minority groups. Additionally, minorities often face difficulties during their attempts in accessing healthcare, including linguistic and cultural barriers. These barriers are primarily manifested in communication and other interactions between the patient and the healthcare provider. Communication difficulties and misunderstandings may lead to frustration and prejudice among caregivers and also to a lack of cooperation from patients, and consequently, may contribute to poorer health outcomes. Therefore, in order to ensure the highest quality of care for migrants, ethnic or other minority populations in our increasingly diverse societies, it is of crucial importance to overcome the difficulties arising from linguistic, cultural and religious differences. To achieve these goals, an important step is the development of intercultural competences within the healthcare system.

Renal biopsy, performed in 68 patients, proved proliferative lupus nephritis in 55 and pure membranous lupus nephritis in 6 patients. Administering combined immunosuppressive therapy, complete remission was achieved in 50 and partial remission in 21 cases; one or repeated relapses developed in 28 subjects. Two patients, by the time they got under our care, had already required chronic dialysis, and in the long term, three more patients progressed to end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy. Renal function stabilized in all other participants, clinical activity of SLE, SLEDAI score, complement levels and immunserology results improved significantly. Lupus nephritis can be effectively treated by combined induction and prolonged maintenance immunosuppression, but to prevent progression of the disease, long-term care is necessary by co-operation of nephrologist and immunologist. To provide adequate prevention and therapy of the SLE's multiorgan involvement and also the potential complications of immunosuppression, multidisciplinary team is needed with all specialists who may facilitate these patients' complex care. For the long-term management of patients with lupus nephritis, the nephrologists have to be responsible, and the multidisciplinary teams also have to be under their direction.

The lack of standardization of sampling, the self-reported, inhomogeneous user habits, the huge number of potential etiologies, and certain trade/legal loopholes (such as online distribution, black market penetration, or the inefficient regulatory control regarding the quantity and/or quality of ingredients/cutting agents) might question the validity of the data and the consequent conclusions. Furthermore, an interesting but by no means negligible question is the fact why no EVALI cases have been registered outside the US when electronic cigarettes and vapes have become increasingly popular worldwide. The present review seeks to answer whether vitamin E acetate is indeed the cause of this complex syndrome, what potentially non-healthcare related factors might have contributed to the rapid increase and decline in EVALI cases, and last but not least the minimum standards of safe vaping (as potential for drug delivery route for cannbinoids).

The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed use of telepsychiatry and broken down barriers to use technology that existed until recently giving way to a 'can do' approach. The editorial rightly discusses accelerating use of information technology in psychiatry. This is a good time to collect global experience and this is a view from telepsychiatry use in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Whilst telepsychiatry has always been available, there was a notable reluctance to embrace it despite support from accrediting bodies such as the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists which endorsed the view that it can be an option when in person consults were not feasible. Like most public mental health services in Australia, our service also moved to tele psychiatry quickly after COVID-19 to provide safe consulting services. We collated some of our experiences by conducting a rapid survey, which was sent out to 40 people with 14 responses. 70% of the respondents reported the number of teleconsults had increased significantly during this time and a further 70% noted that there were fewer missed appointments and the work was generally more efficient following the transition to tele psychiatry. 79% were satisfied with the care they were able to provide. A few challenges were also encountered during this transition. Difficulty using new technology was experienced by 70% of the respondents. A plethora of platforms such as Zoom, Doxy, CoViu, etc., are available in Australia, each with their own benefits and concerns. There was lack of consensus about which platform to use and guidelines changed frequently requiring learning and relearning when switching between platforms, creating difficulty for some staff and patients alike. Other difficulties experienced by the team were maintaining therapeutic alliance. Effective communication of empathy and use of non-verbal gestures when doing teleconsults was also a challenge. Lack of data availability to do video consults for some disadvantaged patients was also noted. Training around effective use of information technology could be helpful and the survey revealed that only one out of fourteen respondents had sought such training. Suitability of patients for teleconsults is a key issue to consider. Often, the ones with anxiety and mood spectrum disorders were easier to engage compared to the psychotic or drug using patients who had limited insight. There are advantages of using video over telephone as someone who is teary or hypomanic cannot be readily identified over the latter. Another challenge was the absence of a seamless delivery method to ensure electronic prescription dispatch to the pharmacy. Faxing or emailing prescriptions not only increased the workload, but were also unreliable. We hope that adding the Australian experience with telepsychiatry during the COVID pandemic will help in planning better telepsychiatry services in the future- a future where integration of key clinical functions occur within telehealth platforms enabling delivery of accessible, seamless and safe care.

In this study, we are interested in discovering the underlying transition patterns between different blood pressure states, namely normal state, elevated state, and hypertensive state among the working population in the United States. A multi-state Markov model was built based on 88,966 clinical records from 34,719 participants we collected during the worksite preventive screening from 2012 to 2018. We first investigated the various risk factors, and we found that body mass index (BMI) is the most critical factor for developing new-onset hypertension. The transition probabilities, survival probabilities, and sojourn time of each state were derived given different levels of BMI, age groups, and gender categories. We found the underweight participants are more likely to remain in the current nonhypertensive states within 3 years, while extremely obese participants have a higher probability of developing hypertension. We discovered the distinct transition patterns among male and female participants. On average, the sojourn time in the normal state for normal-weight participants is 4.33 years for females and 2.18 years for their male counterparts. For the extremely obese participants, the average sojourn time in the normal state is 1.38 years for females and 0.71 years for males. In the end, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) application was developed for clinicians to visualize the impact of behavioral interventions on delaying the progression of hypertension. Our analysis can provide a unique insight into hypertension research and proactive interventions.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2020.3006217"}

In this work, we adopt a deep learning-based semantic segmentation framework to solve the RBC classification task. A major challenge for robust segmentation and classification is the large variations on the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address these challenges, we apply deformable convolution layers to the classic U-Net structure and implement the deformable U-Net (dU-Net). U-Net architecture has been shown to offer accurate localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables free-form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. dU-Net is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. Results show that dU-Net can achieve highest accuracy for both binary segmentation and multi-class semantic segmentation tasks, comparing with both unsupervised and state-of-art deep learning-based supervised segmentation methods. Through detailed investigation of the segmentation results, we further conclude that the performance improvement is mainly caused by the deformable convolution layers to better capture overall information of cell images, and its capability of inferring correct cell shape into the prediction without any shape priors.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2020.3000484"}

Notably, using DNA templates with different integrity levels, as measured by the DNA integrity number (DIN), we demonstrated that 16S rRNA copy number quantification is strongly affected by DNA quality and determined a precise correlation between quantification underestimation and DNA degradation levels. Therefore, we propose an input DNA mass correction, according to the observed DIN value, which could prevent inaccurate quantification of 16S copy number in degraded metagenomic DNAs.

Single disease-resistance genes are usually effective for only several years before the pathogen changes genetically to overcome the resistance. Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is one of the most common and persistent wheat diseases worldwide. The development of varieties with multiple resistance is the most economical and effective strategy for preventing stripe rust and stem rust, the two main rust diseases constraining wheat production. Plateau 448 has been widely used in the spring wheat growing region in northwest China, but it has become susceptible to stripe rust and is susceptible to TTKSK. To produce more durable resistance to race TTKSK as well as to stripe rust, four stem rust resistance genes (Sr33, Sr36, Sr-Cad, and Sr43) and three stripe rust resistance genes (Yr5, Yr18, and Yr26) were simultaneously introgressed into Plateau 448 to improve its stem rust (Ug99) and stripe rust resistance using a marker-assisted backcrossing strategy combined with phenotypic selection. We obtained 131 BC1F5 lines that pyramided two to four Ug99 resistance genes and one to two Pst resistance genes simultaneously. Thirteen of these lines were selected for their TTKSK resistance, and all of them exhibited near immunity or high resistance to TTKSK.

Nine lines exhibited not only high resistance to TTKSK and Pst but also better agronomic traits and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit compositions than Plateau 448.", "keywords": ["HMW-GS", "Ug99", "disease resistance", "gene pyramiding", "stripe rust"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1094/PDIS-02-20-0420-RE"}

Teeth were mounted on a mannequin head and a single operator performed the treatment, including endodontic access cavity preparation, root canal detection, preparation, filling and restoration procedures, under magnification. For restorative procedure, a bulk fill flowable layer was applied initially followed by an overlaying of regular composite. After restoration procedures, a new micro-CT scan was performed to check the quality of the coronal restoration by analyzing the percentage volume of empty spaces present in the tooth-restoration interface (gaps) and inside the restoration (voids). Data were analyzed statistically using Shapiro-Wilk and Student's t-tests with a significance level of 5%. All specimens had gaps and voids.

Here, we used mouse models to understand the mechanism of the development of humoral immunity against the vaccine. The vaccine induces robust germinal center responses within a week post-immunization. In lethal virus challenge, we show that CD4+ T-cells alone, but not CD8+ T-cells, are sufficient to confer vaccine-mediated protection. However, the CD4-mediated protection was potentiated in the presence of vaccine-primed CD8+ T-cells. Employing CD8-deficient mice, we show that both the protective traits of CD4+ T-cells and the quality of antibody response to the vaccine are impaired in absence of CD8+ T-cells. We further demonstrate that the poor protective immune response induced by the vaccine in absence of CD8+ T cells is mainly due to the impaired differentiation and function of Tfh-cells, leading to sub-optimal GC-reaction. Our study highlights an unprecedented role of CD8+ T-cells in the establishment of humoral responses to the vaccine.

However, the combined use of MTF with exercise has shown controversial experimental results.

Also, two groups of each, exercised and sedentary animals were treated with MTF for 6 or 12\u00a0months correspondingly, beside the untreated groups. Rats were euthanized at 24\u00a0months. Muscular functionality was analyzed as the relation between the lean mass free of bone with respect to the grip strength. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase content, enzymatic activity and redox state were determined in the gastrocnemius muscle.

This paper examines whether changes in caregiver psychosocial outcomes after a caregiver coaching intervention are associated with decreases in child anxiety. Using programmatic data collected between 2015 and 2019 from participants in a family caregiver coaching intervention (170 caregivers, 294 children), we apply linear mixed models to assess associations between changes in family caregiver well-being, including problem solving, depressive symptoms, burden, health complaints and quality of life, and changes in parent-reported child anxiety. The baseline median Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent score was 17; children aged 6-11 had slightly higher scores. Child anxiety scores decreased on average 2.8 points (SD 8.4) between baseline and follow-up. In adjusted models, decreases in caregiver depressive symptoms and health complaints were associated with decreases in child anxiety. Caregiver problem-solving skills, quality of life, and subjective burden were not associated with changes in child anxiety. Family caregiver-focused interventions that decrease caregiver stress may positively affect children in the household.

Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%-95.26%) and specificity (83.72%-98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified. Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality.

First, most participants reported that measuring function is part of quality, holistic care. However, a minority of participants noted that discussing function, especially IADLs, was not medically relevant. Second, in terms of preferences for measuring function, participants noted that interdisciplinary approaches to measuring function are optimal and that face-to-face assessment is most \"intimate\" and can prompt reflection on one's limitations. However, some participants indicated that self-assessment is less invasive than in-person assessment. Third, participants had varied preferences regarding communicating about function. Participants noted that asking about difficulty with activities versus need for help are distinct and complementary concepts and that providing context is essential when discussing sensitive topics such as functional decline. Most patients and caregivers reported that measuring function was important, preferred face-to-face assessment, and emphasized the importance of providing context when asking about function.

Comparing with the conventional two-user communication system, the proposed SL network with CTDS concealment supports flexible network-type message exchanges between pairwise SLs.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/AO.400262"}

Imaging through point scanning is the most common method of MMF imaging now, which means modulating a scanning focal spot on the end face of fiber by controlling modes in the fiber. However, due to mode interference, there is always a background speckle around the focal spot formed, which affects imaging quality seriously. Increasing controllable modes number can effectively suppress the effects of the background speckle, but it is limited by the number of controllable elements (the elements number of wavefront shaping devices). Here, we propose a new, to the best of our knowledge, method to increase the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of MMF imaging without increasing the number of controllable modes. Wavelength modulation is introduced to suppress the background. The background speckles turn to be uncorrelated, whereas the signal patterns turn to be strongly correlated and can be added when 20 different wavelengths of light form a focal spot at the same position at the distal end of MMF, respectively. Thus, a four-fold enhancement can be gained in CNR at a 200 \u00b5m field-of-view (FOV) by suppressing background speckles.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/AO.398490"}

The progressive triangulated irregular network (TIN) densification (PTD) filtering algorithm is a classic method and is widely used due to its robustness and effectiveness. However, the performance of the PTD filtering algorithm depends on the quality of the initial TIN-based digital terrain model (DTM). The filtering effect is also limited by the tuning of a number of parameters to cope with various terrains. Therefore, an improved PTD filtering algorithm based on a multiscale cylindrical neighborhood (PTD-MSCN) is proposed and implemented to enhance the filtering effect in complex terrains. In the PTD-MSCN algorithm, the multiscale cylindrical neighborhood is used to obtain and densify ground seed points to create a high-quality DTM. By linearly decreasing the radius of the cylindrical neighborhood and the distance threshold, the PTD-MSCN algorithm iteratively finds ground seed points and removes object points. To evaluate the performance of the proposed PTD-MSCN algorithm, it was applied to 15 benchmark LiDAR datasets provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) commission. The experimental results indicated that the average total error can be decreased from 5.31% when using the same parameter set to 3.32% when optimized. Compared with five other publicized PTD filtering algorithms, the proposed PTD-MSCN algorithm is not only superior in accuracy but also more robust.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/AO.394341"}

To preserve the quality of the image, fast corrections of the pistons among subapertures have to be applied, namely, the co-phasing of the array. The image-based co-phasing method via an optimization procedure has been newly developed. Despite simplicity and strong commonality, when dealing with large piston errors, this correction method is also faced with a problem in which the metric function easily falls into the local convergence, especially in the case of broadband imaging with many subapertures. In this study, an improved stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm based on heuristic search is proposed for co-phasing, termed the metaheuristic SPGD algorithm. The heuristic research scheme assists the original SPGD algorithm in getting rid of local extrema. By iterations of this algorithm, the synthetic system can be co-phased without any additional instruments and operations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by means of simulation. Given the efficiency and superiority, it is expected that the method proposed in this study may find wide applications in multi-aperture imaging.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/AO.394501"}

Experimental results using the dithering approach with a commercial fiber bundle showed a substantial decrease in fixed pattern noise and an increase in spatial resolution.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/AO.391825"}

The MRFL splits incoming light into two paths enabling simultaneous capture of the full surgical field and a zoomed-in view of the local surgical site. A fully functional prototype was constructed to demonstrate and test the autofocus, zooming capabilities, and clinical utility of this new laparoscope. The test of the prototype in both dry lab and animal models was successful, but it also revealed several major limitations of the prototype. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the aforementioned MRFL prototype design and results, and the shortcomings associated with its optical and mechanical designs. We then present several methods to address the shortcomings of the existing prototype with a modified optical layout and redesigned mechanics. The performances of the new and old system prototypes are comparatively analyzed in accordance with the design goals of the new MRFL. Finally, we present and demonstrate a real-time digital method for correcting transverse chromatic aberration to further improve the overall image quality, which can be adapted to future MRFL systems.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/AO.393088"}

We propose an optically decrypted microstructure overlapping image technology, hiding the information points of two-dimensional barcodes on the image reservation area in the ticket, and using the optical principle to use the lenticular lens as a decryption component, to make the image produce continuous dynamic effects and increase the difficulty of forgery. In addition, the distribution of embedded parameters and differences will also affect the distortion of hidden information, which may cause the QR code to fail to read, so the median edge detection predictor is proposed for distortion control comparison. The experimental results prove that our method provides low distortion of information-hiding technology.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1364/JOSAA.393182"}
