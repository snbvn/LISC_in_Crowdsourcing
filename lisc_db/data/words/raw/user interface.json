Spirometric manoeuvres held at a tertiary chest diseases hospital were evaluated as to whether the acceptability criteria of \"American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS)\" guideline were maintained or not. Errors determined were classified as unexplosive start of expiration, submaximal effort, cough, closure of glottis, missing closure of the loop ring and early termination of expiration. Among tests evaluated (n= 510), 276 (54.1%) belonged to female and 234 (45.9%) to male subjects. Average age of subjects was 56.1 \u00b1 15.0 years. It was noted that 318 (62.4%) of the tests met acceptability criteria, whereas 192 (37.6%) did not. The most frequently noted error type is submaximal effort by 30.2% followed by missing closure of the loop, early terminaton of expiration, coughing, unexplosive start of expiration and closure of glottis. In the tests whose spirometric maneuvers did not meet the criteria, the mean age of the patients was significantly higher than in the appropriate tests. When the cases were grouped according to their age, it was observed that the rate of conformity of spirometric examinations decreased significantly as the age range increased. Within this study it is the first time in our country that evaluation of spirometric studies has been made to see the rate of conformity with international standarts. Although it is thought that spirometric examinations are not technically appropriate in clinical practice throughout our country, there is no data in the literature. Although the center where the study is conducted is a tertiary chest diseases hospital, the data obtained reveal that in spirometric evaluations, a substantially non-standard examination was performed.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.5578/tt.69716"}

The aim of our study was to synthesize existing literature in order to determine whether CPM is increased in elite athletes compared to healthy controls. Methods A systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for English-language studies that examined CPM in adult elite athlete populations. Results Seven studies were identified; all were of poor to fair methodological quality. There was no overall difference in CPM between elite athletes and controls (Hedges g\u2009=\u20090.37, CI95 -0.03-0.76; p\u2009=\u20090.07). There was heterogeneity between studies, including one that reported significantly less CPM in elite athletes compared to controls. An exploratory meta-regression indicated that a greater number of hours trained per week was associated with higher CPM. Conclusions The overall number and quality of studies was low. Despite nominally favoring higher CPM in elite athletes, aggregate results indicate no significant difference compared to healthy controls. A possible factor explaining the high degree of variability between studies is the number of hours elite athletes spent training. Implications Based on available evidence, athletes do not have remarkable endogenous pain modulation compared to controls. High quality experimental studies are needed to address the effect of hours trained per week on CPM in athletes.", "keywords": ["athletes", "diffuse noxious inhibitory control", "pain modulation", "pain perception", "sports"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1515/sjpain-2019-0153"}

Saccharum officinarum juice (SOJ) is a widely consumed, energy-rich, nutritious substance that has many minerals and enzymes. Saccharum officinarum plant was reported to have anti-thrombosis, anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulatory activities. This study evaluated the reproductive effects of S. officinarum juice in male Wistar rats. A sugarcane press juicer was used to extract S. officinarum juice. Twenty male Wistar rats (100-120 g) grouped into four (n = 5) received 1.0 mL/kg/day distilled water (control), and 1.0, 3.2 and 10.0 mL/kg/day of fresh S. officinarum juice once daily for 8 weeks via gavage. Sperm analysis, histology of testes and epididymides were evaluated by microscopy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used in assessing the serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance at a significance of p < 0.05. SOJ increased fasting blood glucose levels in 3.2 and 10.0 mL/kg groups. The 10.0 mL/kg juice caused a significant increase in testosterone level and sperm count, and it also increased the percentage of aberrant sperm and decreased sperm viability. Saccharum officinarum juice impaired the histological integrity of the testes and epididymides. Thus, S. officinarum juice adversely altered the reproductive functions of male Wistar rats by reducing sperm quality and disrupting testicular architecture.", "keywords": ["Saccharum officinarum juice", "infertility", "sperm quality", "testosterone"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1515/jbcpp-2019-0235"}

Supplement of FLL to OVX rats maintains bone quality by attenuating the reduction in bone mineral density, strength and microstructure.

The so-called z-aligned sheet-based dynamic beam attenuator\u00a0(z-sbDBA) is developed to dynamically compensate variations in patient attenuation across the fan beam and the projection angle. The goal is to enhance image quality and to reduce patient radiation dose. The z-sbDBA consists of an array of attenuation sheets aligned along the z\u00a0direction. In neutral position, the array is focused toward the focal spot. Tilting the z-sbDBA defocuses the sheets, thus reducing the transmission for larger fan beam angles. The structure of the z-sbDBA significantly differs from the previous sheet-based dynamic beam attenuator\u00a0(sbDBA) in two features: (a)\u00a0The sheets of the z-sbDBA are aligned parallel to the detector rows, and (b)\u00a0the height of the sheets increases from the center toward larger fan beam angles. We built a motor actuated prototype of the z-sbDBA integrated into a clinical CT scanner. In experiments, we investigated its feasibility for FFM. We compared the z-sbDBA to common CT bowtie filters in terms of the spectral dependency of the transmission and possible image variance distribution in reconstructed phantom images. Additionally, the potential radiation dose saving using z-sbDBA for ROI imaging was studied. Our experimental results confirm that the z-sbDBA can realize variable transmission profiles of the radiation fluence by only small tilts. Compared to the sbDBA, the z-sbDBA can mitigate some practical and mechanical issues. In comparison to bowtie filters, the spectral dependency is considerably reduced when using the z-sbDBA. Likewise, more homogeneous image variance distributions can be attained in reconstructed phantom images. The z-sbDBA allows controlling the spatial image variance distribution which makes it suitable for ROI imaging. Our comparison on ROI imaging reveals skin dose reductions of up to 35% at equal ROI image quality by using the z-sbDBA. Our new concept for FFM in x-ray CT, the z-sbDBA, was experimentally validated on a clinical CT scanner. It facilitates dynamic FFM by realizing variable transmission profiles across the fan beam angle on a projection-wise basis. This key feature allows for substantial improvements in image quality, a reduction in patient radiation dose, and additionally provides a technical solution for ROI imaging.", "keywords": ["ROI imaging", "computed tomography", "dynamic beam attenuator", "fluence field modulation", "image variance", "x-ray fluence filtration"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1002/mp.14430"}

Using the IBM population detected 13 QTL on seven chromosomes, which were clustered into nine common QTL.

This study examined the impact of both PBMC cryopreservation and PBMC isolation using SepMate density gradient centrifugation on CD39 and CD73 expressing subsets. First, PBMCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of 11 healthy donors by routine Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, cryopreserved and compared with freshly isolated PBMCs by flow cytometry. The proportions of T and B cells expressing combinations of CD39 and CD73 were relatively stable over 6-month cryopreservation, although some T cell combinations revealed small but significant changes. Second, peripheral blood was collected from six healthy donors to compare PBMCs isolated by SepMate or Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Compared with Ficoll-Paque, the more rapid SepMate method yielded 9.1% less PBMCs but did not alter cell viability or proportions of T and B cells expressing combinations of CD39 and CD73. The present study reveals that cryopreservation is suitable for studying T and B cells expressing combinations of CD39 and CD73. However, caution should be exercised when observing small differences in these cryopreserved subsets between different cohorts. Further, SepMate and Ficoll-Paque methods of PBMC isolation show similar results for T and B cell subset analysis; however, SepMate is a faster and easier approach.", "keywords": ["ENTPD1", "Ecto-enzymes", "Liquid biopsy", "NT5E", "Purinergic receptor", "Purinergic signalling"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s11302-020-09714-1"}

The objective of this study is to describe the curriculum and implementation of a cooking class program designed for cancer survivors, housed within an established community-based organization. First, we evaluated the class curriculum for specific constructs. An evidence-based measure of healthy cooking constructs, the Healthy Cooking Index (HCI), was used to analyze included recipes and revealed both summative cooking quality scores and individual constructs underlying the overall curriculum. Second, a self-report questionnaire based on the HCI was conducted during the first and last class of the 6-week series. This allowed for a comparison between baseline cooking practices of participants and class curricula, as well as changes in reported practices after class participation. Using the HCI items and coding system, we found the curriculum focused on seven recurring constructs (measuring fat and oil, using citrus, herbs and spices, low-fat cooking methods, olive oil, and adding fruit and vegetables). Baseline reports demonstrated that many participants already practiced the main constructs driving the curriculum. As a potential result of this overlap, no changes in practices were found between the first and last session among class participants. Cooking classes for cancer survivors should be structured to not only reinforce positive existing behaviors but also to promote other healthy cooking practices and reduce less healthy behaviors such as using red meat and animal fats. The HCI can be used to understand the underlying constructs of existing cooking class curricula and current practices of survivor populations, allowing for a more tailored approach to practical nutrition education in this high-risk group.", "keywords": ["Community organization", "Cooking", "Food preparation", "Survivorship"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s13187-020-01843-w"}

Defining the embyonic mouse\u00a0heart's\u00a0normal function is important for our own\u00a0understanding of human heart\u00a0development and will inform us on treatments and prevention of congenital heart defects (CHD). Traditional methods such as ultrasound or fluorescence-based microscopy are suitable\u00a0for live dynamic imaging, are excellent to visualize structure and connect gene expression to phenotypes, but can be of low quality in resolving fine features and lack imaging depth and scale to fully appreciate organ morphogenesis. Additionally, previous methods can be limited in accommodating a live imaging apparatus capable of sustaining whole embryo development for extended periods time. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is unique in this circumstance because acquisition of three-dimensional images without contrast reagents, at single cell resolution make it a suitable\u00a0modality to visualize fine structures in the developing embryo. OCT setups are highly customizable for live imaging because of the tethered imaging arm, due to its setup as a fiber-based interferometer. OCT allows for 4D (3D\u00a0+\u00a0time) functional imaging of living mouse embryos and can provide functional and mechanical information to ascertain how the heart's pump function changes through development. In this chapter, we will focus on how we use OCT to visualize live heart dynamics at different stages of development and provide mechanical information to reveal functional properties of the developing heart.", "keywords": ["Cardiodynamic analysis", "Cardiovascular development", "Embryo culture", "Heart morphogenesis", "Live imaging", "Mouse", "Optical coherence tomography"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-0716-0916-3_10"}

This suggests that the harm associated with transfusion may offset the benefit of optimizing anemia in an elective splenectomy case.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.sopen.2020.04.002"}

We aimed to examine the evidence in the literature for an association between neutrophil extracellular traps and postoperative metastasis in colorectal cancer. Studies published between 2000 and December 2018 that examined the role of neutrophil extracellular traps in sepsis and inflammation in colorectal cancer and in relation to tumor-related outcomes were identified through a database search of Cochrane, CINAHL, and MEDLINE. Quality and bias assessment was carried out by 2 reviewers. Of 8,940 screened and of the 30 studies included, 21 were observational, 5 were in vivo experimental, 1 was in vitro, and 3 used a combination of these approaches. There is clear evidence from the literature that presence of a preoperative systemic inflammatory response predicts cancer recurrence following potentially curative resection, but the evidence for association of sepsis and progression is lacking. There is robust experimental evidence in murine models showing that neutrophil extracellular traps are present in sepsis and are associated with cancer progression. Some human observational studies corroborate the prognostic significance of neutrophil extracellular traps in progression of colorectal cancer. Further human studies are needed to translate the experimental evidence and to definitively associate sepsis and neutrophil extracellular traps with poor colorectal cancer-specific outcomes.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.sopen.2019.12.005"}

Using Kern's six-step approach, we developed an easy-to-implement, facilitator-friendly mindfulness curriculum for pediatric interns. Curricular sessions were held monthly during preexisting 1-hour didactics over 6 months, facilitated by individuals without mindfulness experience. Learners were assessed on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with postintervention surveys during a pilot in 2016. Qualitative data were used for curricular improvement resulting in the published curriculum. Postcurriculum surveys from our pilot revealed that 69% of interns reported a more positive attitude toward mindfulness, while 62% reported having (1) greater knowledge about evidence supporting mindfulness, (2) improved knowledge on how to apply mindfulness techniques, and (3) the belief that techniques they had learned positively impacted their lives. Thirty-three percent endorsed using mindfulness techniques more frequently than they had prior to the start of the mindfulness curriculum. Our novel curriculum provided longitudinal mindfulness training that meaningfully impacted trainee knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes. The curricular structure overcame the need for local topic experts and was feasible to implement within the confines of our complex program structure. Ongoing work will determine the impact of our curriculum on objective measures of burnout, empathy, and mindfulness.", "keywords": ["Burnout", "Editor's Choice", "Mindfulness", "Pediatrics", "Psychological", "Well-Being/Mental Health", "Wellness"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10933"}
