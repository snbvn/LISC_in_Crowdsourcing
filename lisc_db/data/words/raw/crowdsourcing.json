New datasets on bicycling incidents are available via crowdsourcing applications, with opportunity for analyses that characterize reporting patterns. Our goal was to characterize patterns of injury in crowdsourced bicycle incident reports from BikeMaps.org. We extracted 281 incidents reported on the BikeMaps.org global mapping platform and analyzed 21 explanatory variables representing personal, trip, route, and crash characteristics. We used a balanced random forest classifier to classify three outcomes: (i) collisions resulting in injury requiring medical treatment; (ii) collisions resulting in injury but the bicyclist did not seek medical treatment; and (iii) collisions that did not result in injury. Results indicate the ranked importance and direction of relationship for explanatory variables. By knowing conditions that are most associated with injury we can target interventions to reduce future risk. The most important reporting pattern overall was the type of object the bicyclist collided with. Increased probability of injury requiring medical treatment was associated with collisions with animals, train tracks, transient hazards, and left-turning motor vehicles. Falls, right hooks, and doorings were associated with incidents where the bicyclist was injured but did not seek medical treatment, and conflicts with pedestrians and passing motor vehicles were associated with minor collisions with no injuries. In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bicycling safety would be improved by additional infrastructure to support safe left turns and around train tracks. Our findings support previous research using hospital admissions data that demonstrate how non-motor vehicle crashes can lead to bicyclist injury and that route characteristics and conditions are factors in bicycling collisions. Crowdsourced data have potential to fill gaps in official data such as insurance, police, and hospital reports.", "keywords": ["Bicycling safety", "Citizen science", "Crowdsourced", "Injury"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2020.105695"}

It is especially likely when questions address sensitive topics, such as gambling attitudes, problems and behaviours. A sample of 321 participants were recruited from Amazon's mTurk crowdsourcing platform for a randomized controlled trial investigating an online gambling intervention. Data from this study was used to examine the influence of socially desirable responding on gambling self-report measures over time. At baseline, self-deception (SD), a factor of socially desirable responding, was significantly higher among males than females and among those with household incomes greater than $20,000 per year. Controlling for demographic variability, mixed effects models examining the relationship between socially desirable responding factors [SD and impression management (IM)] and time were conducted. Among males, there were significant interactions between IM with the NORC DSM-IV screen for gambling problems (NODS) and the gambling symptom assessment scale (G-SAS) scores respectively, over time. In other words, males with higher IM scores, demonstrated less change in NODS and G-SAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up compared to males with lower IM scores. There were no significant interactions in any models among females or among the full sample. Controlling the well-documented effect of socially desirable responding on self-reported measures in addictions research should be considered as a method to help reduce error and improve validity.

In the first stage we analysed differences between the answers from 2010 and 2019 and conducted univariate analyses of relationships among particular variables, and between those variables and the socio-demographic characteristics of participants. In the second stage we investigated multivariable associations of willingness to participate and type of consent with awareness, trust and the socio-economic characteristics of participants. According to our study, the general public in Latvia is still not well informed about research biobanks. Fewer respondents have heard about research biobanks than in 2010. At the same time, the number of respondents who are willing to donate biological samples and personal data to a biobank has increased, e.g. the number of respondents who would definitely or probably be willing to provide information about themselves has increased from 25.8.% to 40.7 since 2010. Overall, concerns about the donation of different types of biological samples and data to a biobank have slightly decreased. Public awareness about biobanks is important for their sustainability. It needs to be increased not only by traditional methods of informing the public, but also by more innovative and participatory approaches, e.g. by citizen science projects.

Our aim was to evaluate surgical scar appearance based on operative approach to RP using a validated tool for evaluating psychosocial impact of scar appearance. Methods Men between the ages of 45-80 were surveyed on an online crowdsourcing platform. Well-healed surgical scars after open, multiport (MP) robotic (transperitoneal and extraperitoneal), and single-port (SP) robotic RP were digitally rendered on stock photos to control for patient appearance. Respondents evaluated images using the SCAR-Q psychosocial impact domain. Additionally, different RP scars were ranked by appearance and assigned 10-point appearance scores. Results 234 surveys were included for analysis (completion rate 84.2%). The median age was 54 (IQR:49-61) and 35% (85/234) had previous abdominal surgery, of which 45% (38/85) was robotic or laparoscopic. SP scars had better psychosocial impact scores (median 100 out of 100 vs. 69 and 58) than MP and open, respectively (both P<0.001). SP scars were consistently ranked higher by appearance (median rank 1, IQR:1-1) than MP (2, IQR:2-3) and open (3, IQR:3-4) (P<0.001). SP without assistant port had the highest appearance score (median 9, IQR:7-9) among all scars (P<0.001). Conclusion SP scars scored highest on psychosocial impact and were consistently ranked highest in appearance. These findings may be informative for optimizing both cosmetic appearance and quality of life for patients undergoing RP.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1089/end.2020.0649"}

To do so, we combined cognitive data from the citizen science project Dognition.com with published breed-average genetic polymorphism data, resulting in a dataset of 1654 individuals with cognitive phenotypes representing 49 breeds. We conducted a breed-average genome-wide association study to identify specific polymorphisms associated with breed differences in inhibitory control, communication, memory, and physical reasoning.

In ecology, species interactions, which constitute the functional backbone of ecological communities, can be notoriously difficult to characterise especially when taxa are inconspicuous and the interactions of interest (e.g., trophic events) occur infrequently, rapidly, or variably in space and time. Overcoming such issues has historically required significant time and resource investment to collect sufficient data, precluding the answering of many ecological and evolutionary questions. Here, we show the utility of social media for rapidly collecting observations of ephemeral ecological phenomena with low spatial and temporal predictability by using a Facebook group dedicated to collecting predation events involving reptiles and amphibians in sub-Saharan Africa. We collected over 1900 independent feeding observations using Facebook from 2015 to 2019 involving 83 families of predators and 129 families of prey. Feeding events by snakes were particularly well-represented with close to 1,100 feeding observations recorded. Relative to an extensive literature review spanning 226 sources and 138 years, we found that social media has provided snake dietary records faster than ever before in history with prey being identified to a finer taxonomic resolution and showing only modest concordance with the literature due to the number of novel interactions that were detected. Finally, we demonstrate that social media can outperform other citizen science image-based approaches (iNaturalist and Google Images) highlighting the versatility of social media and its ability to function as a citizen science platform.", "keywords": ["Citizen science", "Crowd-sourcing", "Facebook", "Feeding interactions", "Herpetofauna", "Natural history", "Snake ecology", "Social media", "Southern Africa", "Trophic ecology"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.7717/peerj.9485"}

We asked for methods to predict protein and phosphorylation levels from genomic and transcriptomic data in cancer patients. The best performance was achieved by an ensemble of models, including as predictors transcript level of the corresponding genes, interaction between genes, conservation across tumor types, and phosphosite proximity for phosphorylation prediction. Proteins from metabolic pathways and complexes were the best and worst predicted, respectively.

A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is incorporated to learn the occurrence of such emergencies. The LSTM is able to stochastically predict future emergency situations, acting as an early warning component of the system.

For this purpose, we exploit the ability of computers to learn from past data through deep learning which has been a leading sub-field of AI for image understanding. Our data source is a collection of on-ground photos taken during our long run of birding activity. We employ several state-of-the-art generic object-detection algorithms to learn to detect birds, each being a member of one of the 38 identified species, in natural scenes. The experiments revealed that computer-aided counting outperformed the manual counting with respect to both accuracy and time. As a real-world application of image-based bird counting, we prepared the spatial bird order distribution and species diversity maps of Turkey by utilizing the geographic information system (GIS) technology.

The increasingly abundant crowdsourcing data and floating car data provide new support for improving traffic accident management. This paper investigates the methods to predict the complicated behavior of traffic flow evolution after traffic accidents using crowdsourcing data. Based on the available data source, the traffic condition is divided into four levels by congestion delay index: severely congested, congested, slow moving and uncongested. Four types of accidents are consequently defined based on the occurrence of each level. A hierarchical scheme is designed for identifying the most congested level and sequentially predicting duration of each level. The proposed model is validated using traffic accident data in 2017 from an anonymous source in Beijing, China by embedding three machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), in the scheme. The results show NN outperforms the other two models when the assessment is conducted in absolute differences. Meanwhile, RF has a slightly better performance than SVM, especially when predicting the short-period congestion of severely congested level at the first time. By continuously updating the traffic condition information, significant improvement in accuracy can be acquired regardless of the exact model used. This study shows that emerging crowdsourcing data can be used in a real-time analysis of traffic accidents and the proposed model is effective to analyze such data.", "keywords": ["Crowdsourcing data", "Machine learning", "Sequential prediction", "Traffic accidents post-impact"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2020.105696"}

New treatments, such as catheter-based therapies, require further testing to identify which patients are most likely to experience benefit. At the practice level (T3), translating evidence into practice remains challenging. Areas of overuse and underuse will require evidence-based tools to improve care delivery. At the community and population level (T4), public awareness campaigns need thorough impact assessment.

In the present study, we examined how older adults recruited via MTurk might differ from those recruited via a national probability sample, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), on a battery of outcomes related to health and cognition. Using a Latin-square design, we examined the relationship between recruitment time, remuneration amount, and measures of cognitive functioning. We found substantial differences between our MTurk sample and the participants within the HRS, most notably within measures of verbal fluency and analogical reasoning. Additionally, remuneration amount was related to differences in time to complete recruitment, particularly at the lowest remuneration level, where recruitment completion required between 138 and 485 additional hours. While the general consensus has been that MTurk samples are a reasonable proxy for the larger population, this work suggests that researchers should be wary of overgeneralizing research conducted with older adults recruited through this portal.", "keywords": ["HRS", "MTurk", "cognition", "depression", "feasibility", "online participants"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1177/0091415020940197"}

The Chair is a case study demonstrating that local, collaborative, transdisciplinary, trans-sector, and bottom-up approaches offer tremendous opportunities for engaging coastal communities to help support long-lasting solutions that benefit everyone, and especially those living by the sea or making their living from the goods and services provided by the sea. Furthermore, the Chair has successfully integrated most of its experts in oceans and human health from the most prestigious institutions in Catalonia. The Chair focuses on three main topics identified by local stakeholders: Fish and Health; Leisure, Health, and Wellbeing; and Medicines from the Sea. Led by stakeholder engagement, the Chair can serve as a novel approach within the oceans and human health field of study to tackle a variety of environmental and public health challenges related to both communicable and non-communicable diseases, within the context of sociocultural issues.

Here, we analyze the quality of data from a plant phenology network, which tracks biological response to climate change. We apply five algorithms designed to detect outlier observations or inconsistent observers. These methods rely on different quantitative approaches, including residuals of linear models, correlations among observers, deviations from multivariate clusters, and percentile-based outlier removal. We evaluated these methods by comparing the resulting cleaned datasets in terms of time series means, spatial data coverage, and spatial autocorrelations after outlier removal. Spatial autocorrelations were used to determine the efficacy of outlier removal, as they are expected to increase if outliers and inconsistent observations are successfully removed. All data cleaning methods resulted in better Moran's I autocorrelation statistics, with percentile-based outlier removal and the clustering method showing the greatest improvement. Methods based on residual analysis of linear models had the strongest impact on the final bloom time mean estimates, but were among the weakest based on autocorrelation analysis. Removing entire sets of observations from potentially unreliable observers proved least effective. In conclusion, percentile-based outlier removal emerges as a simple and effective method to improve reliability of citizen science phenology observations.", "keywords": ["Citizen science", "Climate change", "Data cleaning", "Data management", "Outlier detection", "Plant phenology"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s00484-020-01968-z"}

Starting in 2011, a mosquito monitoring programme was therefore launched with adult and immature mosquito stages being collected at numerous sites all over Germany both actively by trapping, netting, aspirating and dipping, and passively by the citizen science project 'Mueckenatlas'. Until the end of 2019, about 516,000 mosquito specimens were analysed, with 52 (probably 53) species belonging to seven genera found, including several species not reported for decades due to being extremely rare (Aedes refiki, Anopheles algeriensis, Culex martinii) or local (Culiseta alaskaensis, Cs. glaphyroptera, Cs. ochroptera). In addition to 43 (probably 44 including Cs. subochrea) out of 46 species previously described for Germany, nine species were collected that had never been documented before. These consisted of five species recently established (Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus, Ae. koreicus, An. petragnani, Cs. longiareolata), three species probably introduced on one single occasion only and not established (Ae. aegypti, Ae. berlandi, Ae. pulcritarsis), and a newly described cryptic species of the Anopheles maculipennis complex (An. daciae) that had probably always been present but not been differentiated from its siblings. Two species formerly listed for Germany could not be documented (Ae. cyprius, Ae. nigrinus), while presence is likely for another species (Cs. subochrea), which could not be demonstrated in the monitoring programme as it can neither morphologically nor genetically be reliably distinguished from a closely related species (Cs. annulata) in the female sex. While Cs. annulata males were collected in the present programme, this was not the case with Cs. subochrea. In summary, although some species regarded endemic could not be found during the last 9\u00a0years, the number of culicid species that must be considered firmly established in Germany has increased to 51 (assuming Cs. subochrea and Ae. nigrinus are still present) due to several newly emerged ones but also to one species (Ae. cyprius) that must be considered extinct after almost a century without documentation. Most likely, introduction and establishment of the new species are a consequence of globalisation and climate warming, as three of them are native to Asia (Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus, Ae. koreicus) and three (Ae. albopictus, An. petragnani, Cs. longiareolata) are relatively thermophilic. Another thermophilic species, Uranotaenia unguiculata, which had been described for southwestern Germany in 1994 and had since been found only at the very site of its first detection, was recently documented at additional localities in the northeastern part of the country. As several mosquito species found in Germany are serious pests or potential vectors of disease agents and should be kept under permanent observation or even be controlled immediately on emergence, the German mosquito monitoring programme has recently been institutionalised and perpetuated.", "keywords": ["Climate warming", "Culicidae", "Germany", "Globalisation", "Invasive species", "Inventory", "Mosquito monitoring"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s00436-020-06775-4"}

Photos of bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombus) are submitted to the program by users and verified (species name corrected or assigned as necessary) by an expert. Over 22,000 records from over 4,900 users were used in the analyses. Accuracy was measured in two ways: percent agreement (percent of all records submitted correctly by users) and veracity (percent of all verified records submitted correctly by the users). Users generally perceived it harder to identify species than experts. User perceptions were not significantly different from the observed percent agreement or veracity, while expert perceptions were significantly different (overly optimistic) from the observed percent agreement but not the veracity. We compared user submitted names to final expert verified names and found that, for all species combined, the average percent agreement was 53.20% while the average veracity was 55.86%. There was a wide range in percent agreement values per species, although sample size and the role of chance did affect some species agreements. As the conservation status of species increased to higher levels of extinction risk, species were increasingly more likely to have a lower percent agreement but higher levels of veracity than species of least concern. For each species name submitted, the number of different species verified by experts varied from 1 to 32. Future research may investigate which factors relate to success in user identification through community science.

One explanation may be that these individuals are able to compensate for their lack of intuitive or automatic processing through a quick conscious and deliberate analysis of the emotional cues in faces, voices, and body movements. On these grounds, we assumed that the higher autistic people's ability to reason quickly (i.e. to make quick logical inferences), the fewer problems they should have with determining other people's emotions. In our study, we asked workers on the crowdsourcing marketplace MTurk to complete a questionnaire about their autistic traits, to perform emotion recognition tests, and to complete a test of the ability to reason under time constraints. In our sample of 217 people, we found the expected pattern. Overall, those who had higher values in the autism questionnaire scored lower in the emotion recognition tests. However, when reasoning ability was taken into account, a more nuanced picture emerged: participants with high values both on the autism questionnaire and on the reasoning test recognized emotions as well as individuals with low autistic traits.

The user-friendly packages can make them appealing for use in research grade indoor exposure assessments, but a rigorous scientific evaluation has not been conducted for many monitors on the open market, which leads to uncertainty about the validity of the data. Furthermore, many previous sensor studies were conducted for a relatively short period of time, which may not capture the changes this type of instrument may exhibit over time (known as sensor aging). We evaluated three monitors (AirVisual Pro, Speck, and AirThinx) in an occupied, non-smoking residence over a 12-month period in order to assess the sensors, the built-in calibrations, and the need for additional data to achieve high accuracy for long deployments. Two units of each type of monitor were evaluated in order to assess the precision between units, and a personal DataRAM (pDR-1200) with a filter was placed in the home for about 20% of the sampling period (e.g., about a week each month) to evaluate the accuracy over time. The average PM2.5 mass concentration from the periods of colocation with the pDR were 5.31 \u03bcg/m3 for the gravimetric-corrected pDR (hereafter pDR-corrected), 5.11 and 5.03 \u03bcg/m3 for the AirVisual Pro units, 13.58 and 22.68 \u03bcg/m3 for the Speck units, and 7.56 and 7.57 \u03bcg/m3 for the AirThinx units. The AirVisual Pros exhibited the best accuracy compared to the filter at about 86%, which was slightly better than the nephelometric component of the pDR compared to the filter weight (84%). The accuracies of the Speck (-174 and -405%) and AirThinx (42 and 40%) monitors were much lower. When the 1-minute averaged PM2.5 mass concentrations were categorized by air quality index (AQI), the pDR-corrected matched the AirVisual Pro, Speck, and AirThinx bins about 97, 40, and 87% of the time, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients (R2) between the unit pairs and the pDR were 0.90/0.90, 0.50/0.27, and 0.92/0.93 for the AirVisual Pro, Speck, and AirThinx units, respectively. The R2 between units of the same type were 0.99, 0.17, and 1.00 for the AirVisual Pro, Speck, and AirThinx, respectively. All of the monitors could achieve better accuracy by adding filter corrections and post-processing to correct for known biases in addition to the manufacturer's correction routine. Monthly calibrations yielded the highest accuracies, but nearly as high of accuracies could be achieved with only one or two calibrations for the Air Visual Pro and the AirThinx for many applications. In general, this type of new low-cost monitor shows exciting potential for use in scientific research. However, only one of the three monitors exhibited high accuracy (within 20% of the true mass concentration) without any post processing or additional measurements, so an evaluation of each monitor is essential before the data can be used to confidently evaluate residential exposures.", "keywords": ["AirThinx", "AirVisual Pro", "Indoor Air", "Indoor Exposures", "Low-cost sensors", "PM2.5", "Pollution", "Speck"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117615"}

Currently, there is no public dataset for Chinese medical intent classification, and the datasets of other fields are not applicable to the medical QA system. To solve this problem, we construct a Chinese medical intent dataset (CMID) using the questions from medical QA websites. On this basis, we compare four intent classification models on CMID using a case study. The questions in CMID are obtained from several medical QA websites. The intent annotation standard is developed by the medical experts, which includes four types and 36 subtypes of users' intents. Besides the intent label, CMID also provides two types of additional information, including word segmentation and named entity. We use the crowdsourcing way to annotate the intent information for each Chinese medical question. Word segmentation and named entities are obtained using the Jieba and a well-trained Lattice-LSTM model. We loaded a Chinese medical dictionary consisting of 530,000 for word segmentation to obtain a more accurate result. We also select four popular deep learning-based models and compare their performances of intent classification on CMID.

We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science. Indicators were the most common measures for native biodiversity and ecosystem service topics, while outputs were the most common measures for governance and management.

To begin to address these sources of stress, participants recommended that care teams acknowledge and normalize the impact of congenital heart disease on fathers, provide support for balancing work and family responsibilities, recognize and promote father knowledge and engagement, and provide formal and informal supports for fathers of children with congential heart disease.

For instance, the management of psoriasis with systemic immunotherapies in MM patients can be challenging because of concern about immunosuppression and possible worsening of MM. Online crowdsourcing platforms have recently become innovative tools that can actively empower patients in scientific research by enabling the contribution of health data. One such platform, HealthTree\u00ae, helps MM patients find optimal myeloma treatments and has registered > 6000 patients, many of whom have uploaded medical records and genetic profiles. By taking advantage of patient health data available on HealthTree, researchers can gain a greater understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment responses of patients diagnosed with psoriasis and MM. In this case series, we first report a psoriasis and MM patient treated with the IL-17 inhibitor ixekizumab who demonstrated a temporary, 2-month improvement in MM biomarkers (M-protein, kappa, and kappa:lambda ratio). We then report on the clinical characteristics of 18 patients with verified profiles on HealthTree indicating concurrent psoriasis and MM conditions. We surveyed gender, age, psoriasis type, psoriasis treatment history, myeloma type, myeloma genetic features, and myeloma association with bone damage, hypercalcemia, or osteopenia.

Implementing a carefully designed sampling methodology for citizen scientists, we developed an effective framework for a landscape-level inquiry that might otherwise be resource limited. We assessed the variation in dragonfly Hg concentrations across >450 sites spanning 100 United States National Park Service units and examined intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with the variation in Hg concentrations. Mercury concentrations ranged between 10.4 and 1411 ng/g dry weight across sites and varied among habitat types. Dragonfly total Hg (THg) concentrations were up to 1.8-fold higher in lotic habitats than in lentic habitats and 37% higher in waterbodies with abundant wetlands along their margins than those without wetlands. Mercury concentrations in dragonflies differed among families but were correlated (r2 > 0.80) with each other, enabling adjustment to a consistent family to facilitate spatial comparisons among sampling units. Dragonfly THg concentrations were positively correlated with THg concentrations in both fish and amphibians from the same locations, indicating that dragonfly larvae are effective indicators of Hg bioavailability in aquatic food webs. We used these relationships to develop an integrated impairment index of Hg risk to aquatic ecosytems and found that 12% of site-years exceeded high or severe benchmarks of fish, wildlife, or human health risk. Collectively, this continental-scale study demonstrates the utility of dragonfly larvae for estimating the potential mercury risk to fish and wildlife in aquatic ecosystems and provides a framework for engaging citizen science as a component of landscape Hg monitoring programs.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1021/acs.est.0c01255"}

Social network analysis has the potential to elucidate such multi-level dynamics. While most parrot species are tropical canopy dwellers, a subset have successfully colonised urban habitats, where they are often the focus of much public interest. Our study takes advantage of this to use citizen-science to collect observations of wing-tagged sulphur-crested cockatoos in central Sydney and record their social associations over multiple years. Using a specifically designed mobile phone application \"Wingtags\", we collected over >27,000 citizen-science reports of wing-tagged cockatoos, and built social networks from spatial-temporal co-occurrences in observations for 130 tagged birds. To validate this novel methodology, we GPS-tagged a subset of wing-tagged birds and compared networks built from both data collection methods. We then examined correlates of social network structure before exploring the temporal dynamics of network structure and social associations. Social networks constructed from GPS data and citizen science data were highly correlated, suggesting that this novel methodology is robust. Network structure exhibited little seasonal variability and was largely driven by roost site choice; however, individuals also showed a surprising degree of mixing between roosts in their foraging associations. Finally, within this larger fission-fusion system, individuals tended to maintain specific social ties for long periods of time. There was an effect of age on these temporal dynamics, with aging individuals increasing both social stability and longevity of associations. Our findings highlight the utility of citizen-science to measure social networks in urban species, and add to the evidence that long-lasting social associations can persist in fission-fusion social systems such as those observed in wild sulphur-crested cockatoos.", "keywords": ["\nCacatua galerita\n", "Citizen science", "GPS tracking", "Parrot", "Social complexity", "Social network analysis", "Social stability", "Urban ecology"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1111/1365-2656.13295"}

To achieve this, we need approaches for measuring behavior that are readily scalable, both across participants and over time. Efforts to quantify behavior at scale are impeded by the fact that our methods for measuring human behavior are typically developed and validated for single time-point assessment, in highly controlled settings, and with relatively homogeneous samples. As a result, when taken to scale, these measures often suffer from poor reliability, generalizability, and participant engagement. In this review, we attempt to bridge the gap between gold standard behavioral measurements in the lab or clinic and the large-scale, high frequency assessments needed for precision psychiatry. To do this, we introduce and integrate two frameworks for the translation and validation of behavioral measurements. First, borrowing principles from computer science, we lay out an approach for iterative task development that can optimize behavioral measures based on psychometric, accessibility, and engagement criteria. Second, we advocate for a participatory research framework (e.g., citizen science) that can accelerate task development as well as make large-scale behavioral research more equitable and feasible. Finally, we suggest opportunities enabled by scalable behavioral research to move beyond single time-point assessment and toward dynamic models of behavior that more closely match clinical phenomena.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1038/s41386-020-0757-1"}

Between 2017 and 2019, seven medical schools offered access to the platform during medical students' psychiatry clerkships. Use of the web-based platform was voluntary and not monitored or related to clerkship evaluation. Medical students completed a paper and pencil assessment of the platform at the end of their clerkship. Anonymous and aggregated website use data were gathered in accordance with institutional review board approval. A total of 203 medical students across seven distinct psychiatry clerkships completed the survey. Of these students, 123 (60.6%) reported using the platform and reported accessing a mean of 45 questions. The most common device used to access the platform was a laptop and the second most common was a smartphone.

The participants indicated that risk assessment bodies involved in food safety such as EFSA must recognise that data, methods and expertise (i.e. people) are the three basic elements underlying risk assessments. These elements need constant consideration and adaptation to ensure preparedness for the future. Moreover, it should be recognised that knowledge and expertise are distributed throughout society and are thus not limited to scientists. Aspects considered during the breakout session included: (1) increased complexity, (2) the crowd workforce, (3) citizen science, (4) stakeholder engagement, (5) talent pools and (7) entrepreneurship. To account for future challenges, behavioural, attitudinal and cultural changes must be implemented successfully. At a societal level, people are increasingly going hand in hand with robotics and artificial intelligence in sharing expertise and producing outcome. This needs consideration on ethics and values, both for organisations and individuals. At an organisational level, risk assessment bodies will have to tap into new talent pools and new solutions for a more fluid and ad hoc-based workforce. Future risk assessment bodies will have to actively engage with stakeholders when performing their assessments.

It also creates a model of contribution that enables anyone with an interest in health to contribute meaningfully and in a way that is flexible. Citizen science models have been shown to be extremely effective in other domains such as astronomy and ecology. Cochrane Crowd (crowd.cochrane.org) is a citizen science platform that offers contributors a range of microtasks, designed to help identify and describe health research. The platform enables contributors to dive into needed tasks that capture and describe health evidence. Brief interactive training modules and agreement algorithms help to ensure accurate collective decision making. Contributors can work online or offline; they can view their activity and performance in detail. They can choose to work in topic areas of interest to them such dementia or diabetes, and as contributors progress, they unlock milestone rewards and new tasks. Cochrane Crowd was launched in May 2016. It now hosts a range of microtasks which help to identify health evidence and then describe it according to a PICO (Population; Intervention; Comparator; Outcome) ontology. The microtasks are either at 'citation level' in which a contributor is presented with a title and abstract to classify or annotate, or at the full-text level in which a whole or a portion of a full paper is displayed. To date (March 2019), the Cochrane Crowd community comprises over 12,000 contributors from more than 180 countries. Almost 3\u00a0million individual classifications have been made, and around 70,000 reports of randomised trials have been identified for Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials. Performance evaluations to assess crowd accuracy have shown crowd sensitivity is 99.1%, and crowd specificity is 99%. Main motivations for involvement are that people want to help Cochrane, and people want to learn. This model of contribution is now an established part of Cochrane's effort to manage the deluge of information produced in a way that offers contributors a chance to get involved, learn and play a crucial role in evidence production. Our experience has shown that people want to be involved and that, with little or no prior experience, can do certain tasks to a very high degree of collective accuracy. Using a citizen science approach effectively has enabled Cochrane to better support its expert community through better use of human effort. It has also generated large, high-quality data sets on a scale not carried out before which has provided training material for machine learning routines.

The installation of temporary pop-up parks in urban areas is one way for urban communities to obtain these benefits. In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered by researchers, the city council, a local investment company, and community residents that informed the initiation, iteration, and incremental expansion of a series of temporary, summer pop-up parks in the downtown business district of the City of Los Altos in Northern California over a 4-year period (2013-2016). Results showed that the parks were visited by a large, multigenerational group of users who engaged in leisure-time physical activity, shopped at local stores, attended programed events, and socialized with others. Direct observation and survey data gathered in year 2014 also indicated that foot traffic into businesses directly fronting on a pop-up park (n\u00a0=\u20098) was higher during a 4-day period when the park was in place, as compared to a similar 4-day period before the park was installed. The majority of downtown business owners/managers reported no decrease in sales compared to the month before the pop-up park was installed. City sales tax data indicated increases in year-on-year sales tax revenue in the summer quarter of 2014 and 2016 compared with the year (2015) when there was no downtown pop-up park. Perspectives of community residents collected before, during, and after the installation of the pop-up parks indicated that the pop-up park created a vibrant space in an otherwise underutilized area that was enjoyed by a variety of people in a host of ways (e.g., children playing, families relaxing, people shopping and eating at downtown stores and restaurants, people of all ages attending scheduled park events). These results informed a number of discussions and meetings between key stakeholders about the pop-up parks, culminating in a temporary park that was held in a new location in 2017 that was substantially larger in size, installed for a longer time period, cost more, and had more scheduled park events. Results from this prospective investigation of the initial impacts of pop-up parks in this urban location provide insights regarding the potential benefits and viability of such temporary parks for residents and businesses alike.", "keywords": ["Citizen science", "Economic development", "Mixed-methods study", "Physical activity", "Pop-up parks", "Public-private partnerships"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s11524-020-00434-w"}

A cloud-computing solution provided real-time air quality data for risk screening purposes, data analytics and curricular activities. The citizen-science project engaged with 14 high school students over a four-year period that is continuing to this day. The project led to the development of a website that displayed sensor-based measurements in local neighborhoods and a GitHub-like repository for open source code and instructions. Preliminary results showed a reasonable comparison between sensor-based and EPA land-based federal reference monitor data for CO and NOx. Initial sensor-based data collection efforts showed reasonable agreement with land-based federal reference monitors but more work needs to be done to validate these results.

A significant finding is variance in the distribution of mammals and birds at different times of day. These findings reflect diurnal variation in the activity levels of different species and underline the need for data on a targeted species to be collected at appropriate times of day.

The aim of this article is to analyze research data management practices in existing biomedical citizen science studies, so as to provide insights for members of the public and of the research community considering this approach to research. A scoping review was conducted on this topic to determine data management characteristics of health and bio medical citizen science research. From this review and related web searching, we chose five online platforms and a specific research project associated with each, to understand their research data management approaches and enablers. Health and biomedical citizen science platforms and projects are diverse in terms of types of work with data and data management activities that in themselves may have scientific merit. However, consistent approaches in the use of research data management models or practices seem lacking, or at least are not prevalent in the review. There is potential for important data collection and analysis activities to be opaque or irreproducible in health and biomedical citizen science initiatives without the implementation of a research data management model that is transparent and accessible to team members and to external audiences. This situation might be improved with participatory development of standards that can be applied to diverse projects and platforms, across the research data life cycle.", "keywords": ["citizen science", "crowdsourcing", "participatory health", "research data management", "self-quantification"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1093/jamiaopen/ooz052"}

The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the burden of mandibular asymmetry in CFM, and to accurately evaluate the impact of early MDO on patients' perceived quality of life and social acceptance, in addition to examining the cost-effectiveness of early MDO in CFM. A validated crowdsourcing platform was utilized to recruit participants. Psychosocial acceptance and utility outcomes were assessed for patients with CFM. Participants were presented with health-state scenarios supplemented with pre- and postoperative images. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were subsequently calculated and costs were estimated based on Medicare fee schedules using the Current Procedural Terminology codes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for early MDO were calculated and plotted against a $100,000/QALY threshold. A total of 463 participants were included in the study. The mean visual analog scale score for untreated mandibular hypoplasia in CFM was 0.48\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.24, which improved significantly (P < 0.0001) to 0.63\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.20 following early MDO. Time trade-off scores for an imaginary surgery leading to perfect health with no complications were not statistically different from undergoing early MDO (P = 0.113). Early mandibular distraction decreased social distance in all 8 social situations assessed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied by the duration of time between early MDO and a potential second intervention, ranging from $148,142.09 per QALY gained at an interval of 1 year to $9876.14 per QALY gained after 15 years. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, early MDO in CFM becomes cost-effective when patients enjoy an improved health-state post-MDO for more than 1.48 years before a potential second intervention, if deemed necessary. Early mandibular distraction may lead to tangible positive gains in CFM patients based on utility outcome scores, psychosocial acceptance, and social distance. Therefore, although further interventions may be needed at skeletal maturity, early MDO can improve the psychological well-being of CFM patients during their crucial developmental years in a cost-effective manner. The incremental cost per QALY gained post-early MDO correlates negatively with time until a second potential surgical intervention.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000006622"}

Four hundred forty-four high-risk MSM will be recruited online and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to (1) standard syphilis self-testing arm; (2) a self-testing arm program enhanced with crowdsourcing and a lottery-based incentive, and (3) a standard of care (control). Self-testing services include a free syphilis self-test kit through the mail at monthly intervals. Participants in the lottery incentive arm will additionally receive health promotion materials generated from an open crowdsourcing contest and be given a lottery draw with a 10% chance to win 100 RMB (approximately 15 US Dollars) upon confirmed completion of syphilis testing. Syphilis self-test kits have step-by-step instructions and an instructional video. This is a non-blinded, open-label, parallel RCT. Participants in each arm will be followed-up at three and 6 months through WeChat (a social media app like Facebook messenger). Confirmation of syphilis self-test use will be determined by requiring participants to submit a photo of the used test kit to study staff via secure data messaging. Both self-testing and facility-based testing will be ascertained by sending a secure photographic image of the completed kit through an existing digital platform. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who tested for syphilis in the past 3 months. Findings from this study will provide much needed insight on the impact of syphilis self-testing on promoting routine syphilis screening among MSM. The findings will also contribute to our understanding of the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of syphilis self-testing.

We collected 1524 questions with complete patient-doctor interaction processes from an online health community in China to test all the hypotheses. We divided the doctors into 2 groups based on the sequence of the answers: (1) doctor who answered the patient's question first and (2) the doctors who answered that question after the doctor who answered first. All analyses were conducted using the ordinary least squares method. First, the ability of the doctor who first answered the health-related question was found to positively influence the participation of the following doctors who answered after the first doctor responded to the question (\u03b2offline1=.177, P<.001; \u03b2offline2=.063, P=.048; \u03b2online=.418, P<.001). Second, the reward that the patient offered for the best answer showed a positive effect on doctors' participation (\u03b2=.019, P<.001). Third, the question's complexity was found to positively moderate the relationships between the ability of the first doctor who answered and the participation of the following doctors (\u03b2=.186, P=.05) and to mitigate the effect between the reward and the participation of the following doctors (\u03b2=-.003, P=.10). This study has both theoretical and practical contributions. Online health community managers can build effective incentive mechanisms to encourage highly competent doctors to participate in the provision of medical services in crowdsourced health care information websites and they can increase the reward incentives for each question to increase the participation of the doctors.", "keywords": ["crowdsourced medical services", "crowdsourcing", "doctors\u2019 participation", "elaboration-likelihood model", "online health communities"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.2196/16704"}

Community-led citizen science (CLCS) is creating different research instruments with different measurement goals and processes. This paper identifies four design attributes for CLCS tools: affordability, accessibility, builds community efficacy and provides actionable data through validating a community method for monitoring the neurotoxic and corrosive gas Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). For $1 per sample, the semi-quantitative method provides an affordable and easily interpretable data for communities to compare H2S concentrations and silver corrosion in their home environments to those in a major municipal sewage treatment plant. H2S is a leading cause of workplace injury in the U.S. and commonly found in oil and gas production, sewage treatment plants, and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Communities neighboring such sources tend to be socio-economically marginalized with little access to scientific or political resources. Consequently, health risks and material degradation from corrosion are well studied in workplaces while community exposures are under-studied. Existing commercial H2S detection methods are prohibitively expensive for low-income communities and often require the support of professional scientists. This paper describes a simple and inexpensive semi-quantitative H2S measurement method that uses photopaper. Photopaper passively measures H2S as its silver halide layer linearly reacts with H2S between concentrations of 60 ppb to 1 ppm, discoloring the paper from white to brown. We develop a colorimetric scale for this discoloration for visual estimation of H2S concentration and overall corrosion. The scale is based on comparing silver sulfide (Ag2S) measured by Purafil Corrosion Classification Coupons (CCCs) and H2S concentrations measured with the industry standard tool a Jerome Meter to silver and sulfur bound to the photopaper as measured with X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). We conduct our validation studies in a major municipal sewage treatment plant to provide real-world occupational benchmarks for comparison to community results. This community science method is affordable, accessible, designed to build collective efficacy and to create actionable data to flag the need for follow-up research.", "keywords": ["Citizen Science", "Community Science", "Corrosion", "Environmental Justice", "Hydrogen Sulfide", "Oil Extraction"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.aeaoa.2019.100049"}

The cities of Regina and Saskatoon, Canada. 538 citizen scientists (\u226518 years) provided PA data during eight consecutive days using a custom-built smartphone application, and after applying a rigid inclusion criteria, 89 were included in the final analysis. EMAs enabled reporting of light, moderate, and vigorous PA, as well as physical and social contexts of PA. Retrospective PA was reported using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). For both measures, PA intensities were categorised into mean minutes of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA per day. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and Spearman correlation procedures were conducted to compare PA intensities reported via EMAs and IPAQ. Using EMAs, citizen scientists reported 140.91, 87.16 and 70.38 mean min/day of overall, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA, respectively, whereas using IPAQ they reported 194.39, 116.99 and 98.42 mean min/day of overall, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA, respectively.

In comparison with EMAs, using IPAQ, citizen scientists reported significantly greater overall PA in active transportation (p=0.002) and recreation, sport and leisure-time domains (p=0.003). This digital epidemiological and citizen science methodology adapted mobile EMAs to capture not only prospective PA, but also important physical and social contexts within which individuals accumulate PA.

Our best-performing algorithm achieved good agreement with radiologists who were qualified interpreters of mammograms, with a four-class \u03ba of 0.667. When training was performed with randomly sampled images from the data set versus sampling equal number of images from each density category, the model predictions were biased away from the low-prevalence categories such as extremely dense breasts. The net result was an increase in sensitivity and a decrease in specificity for predicting dense breasts for equal class compared with random sampling. We also found that the performance of the model degrades when we evaluate on digital mammography data formats that differ from the one that we trained on, emphasizing the importance of multi-institutional training sets. Lastly, we showed that crowdsourced annotations, including those from attendees who routinely read mammograms, had higher agreement with our algorithm than with the original interpreting radiologists. We demonstrated the possible parameters that can influence the performance of the model and how crowdsourcing can be used for evaluation.

To solve it, the public requires basic information, such as understanding where rates of fatal police violence are particularly high, and for which groups. Existing mapping efforts, though critically important, often use inappropriate statistical methods and can produce misleading, unstable rates when denominators are small. To fill this gap, we use inverse-variance-weighted multilevel models to estimate overall and race-stratified rates of fatal police violence for all Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the U.S. (2013-2017), as well as racial inequities in these rates. We analyzed the most recent, reliable data from Fatal Encounters, a citizen science initiative that aggregates and verifies media reports. Rates of police-related fatalities varied dramatically, with the deadliest MSAs exhibiting rates nine times those of the least deadly. Overall rates in Southwestern MSAs were highest, with lower rates in the northern Midwest and Northeast. Yet this pattern was reversed for Black-White inequities, with Northeast and Midwest MSAs exhibiting the highest inequities nationwide. Our main results excluded deaths that could be considered accidents (e.g., vehicular collisions), but sensitivity analyses demonstrated that doing so may underestimate the rate of fatal police violence in some MSAs by 60%. Black-White and Latinx-White inequities were slightly underestimated nationally by excluding reportedly 'accidental' deaths, but MSA-specific inequities were sometimes severely under- or over-estimated. Preventing fatal police violence in different areas of the country will likely require unique solutions. Estimates of the severity of these problems (overall rates, racial inequities, specific causes of death) in any given MSA are quite sensitive to which types of deaths are analyzed, and whether race and cause of death are attributed correctly. Monitoring and mapping these rates using appropriate methods is critical for government accountability and successful prevention.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0229686"}

We assessed the efficacy of prophylaxis after a tick bite in Europe. We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial, administering a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline within 72 hours after removing an attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment. Potential participants \u2265 8 years of age who reported a recent tick bite online were invited for the study. After informed consent, they were randomly assigned to either the prophylaxis or the no-treatment group. Participants in the prophylaxis group were asked to visit their general practitioner to administer the antibiotics. All participants were followed up by online questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the development of physician-confirmed Lyme borreliosis in a modified-intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3953) and is closed. Between April 11, 2013, and June 10, 2015, 3538 potential participants were randomized, of whom 1689 were included in the modified-intention-to-treat analysis. 10 cases of Lyme borreliosis were reported out of 1041 participants (0\u202296 %) in the prophylaxis group, and 19 cases out of 648 no-treatment participants (2\u20229 %), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 31 - 84%), and a number-needed-to-treat of 51 (95% CI 29 - 180). No serious adverse events were reported.

We found that locations with earlier PLCstart dates (day of year 265-294) displayed steeper slopes in elevation per degree of latitude than locations with later PLCstart dates (day of year 295-314). This statistically significant result indicates that the influence of elevation on PLCstart (vertical gradient) weakened as the leaf colouring season progressed in Japan. In addition to these spatial characteristics, the PLCstart and the warmth index (based on monthly mean air temperature) showed significant linear correlations for latitudinal and elevational gradients. This result suggests that the sensitivity of PLCstart to air temperature, as manifested in both latitudinal and elevational gradients, is constant.

We evaluated the performance of three subtype scorers: \"experts, researchers and non-experts\", as well as 7 previously published spindle detection algorithms. Our findings show that only two algorithms had performance scores similar to human experts. Furthermore, the human scorers agreed on the average spindle characteristics (density, duration and amplitude), but there were significant age and sex differences (also observed in the set of detected spindles).

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions are an early feature of AD and are also linked to obesity. We recently showed that non-flowing capillaries, caused by adhered neutrophils, contribute to CBF reduction in mouse models of AD. Because obesity could exacerbate the vascular inflammation likely underlying this neutrophil adhesion, we tested links between obesity and AD by feeding APP/PS1 mice a high fat diet (Hfd) and evaluating behavioral, physiological, and pathological changes. We found trends toward poorer memory performance in APP/PS1 mice fed a Hfd, impaired social interactions with either APP/PS1 genotype or a Hfd, and synergistic impairment of sensory-motor function in APP/PS1 mice fed a Hfd. The Hfd led to increases in amyloid-beta monomers and plaques in APP/PS1 mice, as well as increased brain inflammation. These results agree with previous reports showing obesity exacerbates AD-related pathology and symptoms in mice. We used a crowd-sourced, citizen science approach to analyze imaging data to determine the impact of the APP/PS1 genotype and a Hfd on\u00a0capillary stalling and CBF. Surprisingly, we did not see an increase in the number of non-flowing capillaries or a worsening of the CBF deficit in APP/PS1 mice fed a Hfd as compared to controls, suggesting that capillary stalling is not a mechanistic link between a Hfd and increased severity of AD in mice. Reducing capillary stalling by blocking neutrophil adhesion improved CBF and short-term memory function in APP/PS1 mice, even when fed a Hfd.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-65908-y"}

This study empowers the affected villagers to make risk management decisions via a community citizen science approach. First, field investigations were performed with the affected community to identify hot spots at the waste heap releasing gaseous pollutants that may exceed acceptable levels. Next, existing monitoring data previously collected by the community were interpreted as clear evidence of past poor waste management. Information about suppression of existing fire and mine waste storage options was presented to the community for them to make an informed decision about the most appropriate corrective action that should be taken by the mine. The mining company chose to use surface sealing for both suppression of existing fire and on-site storage of the mine waste but did not install any long-term monitoring system. Nevertheless, the community's choice was surface sealing with preventive monitoring together with emergency response, which is the more scientifically appropriate option. This outcome of a science-based risk management decision by the community will be forwarded to the regional government for enforcement.

Our objectives were to define underlying baseline patterns of loon reproductive success in Ontario, Canada, and to identify drivers of temporal changes in loon productivity. We analyzed 38\u00a0years of reproductive data from over 1500 lakes using data from the Canadian Lakes Loon Survey, a citizen science loon monitoring program managed by Birds Canada that has run annually in Ontario since 1981. Overall, we estimated a declining trend in common loon reproductive success of -0.10 six-week-old young per pair per year in Ontario between 1981 and 2018. We assessed the influence of 14 factors on loon reproductive success. We identified low pH and associated higher mercury as factors linked to loon productivity declines. We also demonstrated that lake area, longitude, and April temperatures can predict the number of six-week-old young per pair per year. We hypothesize that climate change-induced stress, acting through multiple interacting pathways involving mercury acidity, fish abundance, lake size, and geographic location, may account for declining loon productivity.

The objective of the present study was to survey the prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Ixodes ricinus and to associate TBEV genetic findings with TBE infections in the OWH. Ticks were collected by the flagging methods supported by a crowdsourcing project implementing the interested public as collectors to cover completely and collect randomly a 3532\u00a0km2 area of the OWH TBE risk region. Prevalence of TBEV in I. ricinus was analysed by reversed transcription quantitative real-time PCR. Phylogeographic analysis was performed to classify OWH TBEV isolates within a European network of known TBEV strains. Mutational sequence analysis including 3D modelling of envelope protein pE was performed and based on a clinical database, a spatial association of TBE case frequency and severity was undertaken. Using the crowd sourcing approach we could analyse a total of 17,893 ticks. The prevalence of TBEV in I. ricinus in the OWH varied, depending on analysed districts from 0.12% to 0% (mean 0.04%). Calculated minimum infection rate (MIR) was one decimal power higher. All TBEV isolates belonged to the European subtype. Sequence analysis revealed a discontinuous segregation pattern of OWH isolates with two putative different lineages and a spatial association of two isolates with increased TBE case numbers as well as exceptional severe to fatal infection courses. TBEV prevalence within the OWH risk regions is comparatively low which is probably due to our methodological approach and may more likely reflect prevalence of natural TBEV foci. As for other European regions, TBEV genetics show a discontinuous phylogeny indicating among others an association with bird migration.

Israel's climate poses challenges in analyzing data from year-round butterfly activity, as in other tropical or arid countries. The Regional Generalized Additive Model (Regional GAM) is a butterfly phenology and abundance model based on repeat visits throughout species' flight season. We tested the applicability of Regional GAM for species with complex flight seasonality (e.g., multivoltine) by comparing estimated abundance and seasonal indices for the full data set and rarefied subsets. We assessed the reliability of modeled flight seasons and compared abundance estimates per site resulting from biologically plausible and unreliable seasonal models. The reliability of Regional GAM rises with the number of observations, and the model tends to produce more biologically plausible models for species with simple phenologies (e.g., univoltine with a single peak in activity). Abundance estimates based on unreliable models produce values with inter-quartile ranges of 90%-153% compared with biologically plausible models, while peak time changes with an interquartile range of 0-22.5\u00a0d when comparing all rarefied models with the full data set. Regional GAM should be applied with great caution for rare species and those with a complex flight season, and the date of year start needs to be carefully chosen for species that are active year-round. We identified the key sources of error and propose an operational workflow to address them. With few adaptations, Regional GAM can support new BMSs in analyzing data where butterflies are active year-round, including tropical climates.

Domestic dogs are a valuable study system for questions regarding the evolution of phenotypic diversity due to their extraordinary intraspecific variation. While previous studies have investigated morphological and behavioral variation across dog breeds, few studies have systematically assessed breed differences in cognition. We integrated data from Dognition.com-a citizen science project on dog cognition-with breed-averaged genetic data from published sources to estimate the among-breed heritability of cognitive traits using mixed models. The resulting dataset included 11 cognitive measures for 1508 adult dogs across 36 breeds. A factor analysis yielded four factors interpreted as reflecting inhibitory control, communication, memory, and physical reasoning. Narrow-sense among-breed heritability estimates-reflecting the proportion of cognitive variance attributable to additive genetic variation-revealed that scores on the inhibitory control and communication factors were highly heritable (inhibitory control: h2\u2009=\u20090.70; communication: h2\u2009=\u20090.39), while memory and physical reasoning were less heritable (memory: h2\u2009=\u20090.17; physical reasoning: h2\u2009=\u20090.21). Although the heritability of inhibitory control is partially explained by body weight, controlling for breed-average weight still yields a high heritability estimate (h2\u2009=\u20090.50), while other factors are minimally affected. Our results indicate that cognitive phenotypes in dogs covary with breed relatedness and suggest that cognitive traits have strong potential to undergo selection. The highest heritabilities were observed for inhibitory control and communication, both of which are hypothesized to have been altered by domestication.", "keywords": ["Breed differences", "Canine cognition", "Citizen science", "Cognitive evolution", "Domestication", "Test battery"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s10071-020-01400-4"}

The abundance data of dragonflies in the stormwater ponds were collected with a scientific, standardized design. Our results showed that the citizen science datasets differed significantly from datasets collected scientifically in stormwater ponds. Hence, we could not predict biodiversity in stormwater ponds from the data collected by citizen scientists. Using CSD from past versus recent years or from small versus large areas surrounding the stormwater ponds did not change the outcome of our tests. However, we found that biodiversity patterns obtained with CSD were similar to those from stormwater ponds when we restricted our analyses to rare species. We also found a higher beta diversity for the CSD compared to the stormwater dataset. Our results suggest that if CSD are to be used for estimating or predicting biodiversity, we need to develop methods that take into account or correct for the under-reporting of common species in CSD.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-66306-0"}

Its dispersion would be favoured by its wide food habit and its tendency to live linked to humans, being the plant trade its most plausible vector of dispersion. Here, we explored the potential distribution of O. nungara on a global scale by using the MaxEnt software. We used 144 records (encompassing 10 countries) from sampling campaigns, citizen science, recent literature, and material deposited in scientific collections. Our results showed that southern South America has favourable climatic conditions for O. nungara. MaxEnt also allowed predicting expansions to countries of Europe where this planarian is already established and to others not yet colonized, as well as to Asia (southern coast of the Caspian Sea, Taiwan, and south-east of mainland China) and Oceania (south-east of Australia and New Zealand). The potential distribution of O. nungara was mainly outlined by climatic factors related to temperature (annual mean temperature, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, and annual temperature range). Thus, under a global warming scenario, a significant expansion of O. nungara relative to the current prediction is expected.

While research is emerging on developing citizen science projects by optimising technological modalities, little consideration has been given to understanding what motivates individuals to voluntarily contribute data. Here, we use the Volunteer Functions Inventory, combined with open-ended questions, to demonstrate that the two strongest motivations underpinning participation, for both individuals who contribute data systematically (regularly; n\u00a0=\u00a0177) and opportunistically (ad hoc basis; n\u00a0=\u00a0218), are 'Values' and 'Understanding'. People take part in such projects because they have an intrinsic value for the environment and want to support research efforts (representing 'Values'), as well as wanting to learn and gain knowledge (signifying 'Understanding'). Unlike more traditional citizen science projects that involve specific training and considerable time investments, contributors to these newer types of project are not motivated by the potential to develop their career or opportunities for social interaction. The person-level characteristics of contributors considered in this study did not reliably forecast levels of motivation, suggesting that predicting high levels of motivation is inherently more complex than is often speculated.

This paper represents the first phase of a three stage action research spiral whereby the authors evaluated the use of a novel tool for curriculum design processes, anonymised crowdsourcing. This initial phase was open to all students enrolled on an undergraduate diagnostic radiography programme in the UK. To confirm the reliability of the crowdsource design an established eight point crowdsourcing verification tool was applied. Twenty-three unique ideas were generated by participants, 40 comments made and 173 votes cast. Inductive analysis of the comments generated five themes. These included: the role of technology enhanced learning; simulation activities; patient focused curriculum; mental wealth (resilience) authentic assessment approaches. An evaluation of those who had and had not engaged highlighted areas of improvement for the administration of the second and third iterations which will include a wider pool of participants. This study from a single programme offers lessons for others wishing to adopt and develop this approach elsewhere.

Women who had two vaccination encounters during surveillance were identified and AEFI rates compared for each dose. Among 13,758 participants, overall AEFI rates were lower following IIV (4.9%) than dTpa (6.4%) or IIV and dTpa given concomitantly (7.4%). The AEFI profile was similar for both vaccines, with injection site reactions, tiredness, and headache most commonly reported. Injection site pain and swelling/redness were significantly more common in women who received dTpa than IIV. Reports of medical attendance following immunisation were similar (0.3%) for each vaccine group.
