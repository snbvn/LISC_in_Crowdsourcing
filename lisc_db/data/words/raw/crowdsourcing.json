Although the approaches are interdependent, they have often proceeded as parallel research traditions.

Simulation has proved beneficial for teaching and improving these skills for residents, but similar benefits have not yet been realized for practicing orthopedic surgeons. A vision is presented to elevate community orthopedic practice and improve patient safety by advancing the use of simulators for training and assessing surgical skills. Key elements of this vision that are established include 1) methods for the objective and rigorous assessment of the performance of practicing surgeons now exist, 2) simulators are sufficiently mature and sophisticated that practicing surgeons will use them, and 3) practicing surgeons can improve their performance with appropriate feedback and coaching. Data presented indicate that surgical performance can be adequately and comparably measured using structured observations made by experts or non-expert crowds, with the crowdsourcing approach being more expedient and less expensive. Rigorous measures of the surgical result and intermediate objectives obtained semi-automatically from intra-operative fluoroscopic image sequences can distinguish performances of experts from novices. Experience suggests that practicing orthopedic surgeons are open to and can be constructively engaged by a family of mature simulators as a means to evaluate and improve their surgical skills. The results presented support our contention that new objective assessment measures are sufficient for evaluating the performance of working surgeons. The novel class of orthopedic surgical simulators available were tested and approved by practicing physicians. There exists a clear opportunity to combine purpose-designed simulator exercises with virtual coaching to help practicing physicians retain, retrain, and improve their technical skills. This will ultimately reduce cost, increase the quality of care, and decrease complication rates. This vision articulates a means to boost the confidence of practitioners and ease their anxiety so that they perform impactful procedures more often in community hospitals, which promises to improve treatment and reduce the cost of care while keeping patients closer to their homes and families.", "keywords": ["performance assessment", "surgical skills training"], "year": 2020, "doi": null}

We extracted 281 incidents reported on the BikeMaps.org global mapping platform and analyzed 21 explanatory variables representing personal, trip, route, and crash characteristics. We used a balanced random forest classifier to classify three outcomes: (i) collisions resulting in injury requiring medical treatment; (ii) collisions resulting in injury but the bicyclist did not seek medical treatment; and (iii) collisions that did not result in injury. Results indicate the ranked importance and direction of relationship for explanatory variables. By knowing conditions that are most associated with injury we can target interventions to reduce future risk. The most important reporting pattern overall was the type of object the bicyclist collided with. Increased probability of injury requiring medical treatment was associated with collisions with animals, train tracks, transient hazards, and left-turning motor vehicles. Falls, right hooks, and doorings were associated with incidents where the bicyclist was injured but did not seek medical treatment, and conflicts with pedestrians and passing motor vehicles were associated with minor collisions with no injuries. In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bicycling safety would be improved by additional infrastructure to support safe left turns and around train tracks. Our findings support previous research using hospital admissions data that demonstrate how non-motor vehicle crashes can lead to bicyclist injury and that route characteristics and conditions are factors in bicycling collisions.

The objective of this review is to summarize the knowledge concerning the diversity of FAHFAs, nomenclature, and their analysis and detection. Special attention is paid to the total syntheses of FAHFAs, optimal strategies, and to the formation of the stereocenter required for optically active molecules.

Methods Men between the ages of 45-80 were surveyed on an online crowdsourcing platform. Well-healed surgical scars after open, multiport (MP) robotic (transperitoneal and extraperitoneal), and single-port (SP) robotic RP were digitally rendered on stock photos to control for patient appearance. Respondents evaluated images using the SCAR-Q psychosocial impact domain. Additionally, different RP scars were ranked by appearance and assigned 10-point appearance scores. Results 234 surveys were included for analysis (completion rate 84.2%). The median age was 54 (IQR:49-61) and 35% (85/234) had previous abdominal surgery, of which 45% (38/85) was robotic or laparoscopic. SP scars had better psychosocial impact scores (median 100 out of 100 vs. 69 and 58) than MP and open, respectively (both P<0.001). SP scars were consistently ranked higher by appearance (median rank 1, IQR:1-1) than MP (2, IQR:2-3) and open (3, IQR:3-4) (P<0.001). SP without assistant port had the highest appearance score (median 9, IQR:7-9) among all scars (P<0.001). Conclusion SP scars scored highest on psychosocial impact and were consistently ranked highest in appearance. These findings may be informative for optimizing both cosmetic appearance and quality of life for patients undergoing RP.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1089/end.2020.0649"}

This strategy is based on the coordinates of latitude and longitude provided by GNSS to find the locations of these coordinates.

To do so, we combined cognitive data from the citizen science project Dognition.com with published breed-average genetic polymorphism data, resulting in a dataset of 1654 individuals with cognitive phenotypes representing 49 breeds. We conducted a breed-average genome-wide association study to identify specific polymorphisms associated with breed differences in inhibitory control, communication, memory, and physical reasoning.

When we combined results across multiple SNPs within the same gene, we identified 188 genes implicated in breed differences in cognition. This gene set included more genes than expected by chance that were 1) differentially expressed in brain tissue and 2) involved in nervous system functions including peripheral nervous system development, Wnt signaling, presynapse assembly, and synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

The HRS allows us to examine morbidity outcomes not available in administrative data, providing evidence of the mechanisms underlying emerging evidence of mortality reductions due to expanded insurance coverage among the near-elderly. We find that the Medicaid expansion was associated with a 15 percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage which was largely offset by declines in other types of insurance. We find improvements in several measures of health including a 12% reduction in metabolic syndrome; a 32% reduction in complications from metabolic syndrome; an 18% reduction in the likelihood of gross motor skills difficulties; and a 34% reduction in compromised activities of daily living (ADLs).

Using the fluorescence assay with a labeled peptide substrate, we found that the crowders affected the kinetics of the NS3/4A-catalyzed reaction differently. The Ficoll crowders increased and PEG decreased the initial and maximum reaction velocities. To explain the opposite effects exerted by PEG as compared to Ficoll, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of NS3/4A in explicit solvent and surrounded by its peptide substrates and PEG molecules. The simulations suggest both hydrophobic and polar/electrostatic interactions between PEG and NS3/4A with hydrogen bonds formed between PEG oxygens and NS3/4A amino acids rich in hydrogen bonds donors.

Overcoming such issues has historically required significant time and resource investment to collect sufficient data, precluding the answering of many ecological and evolutionary questions. Here, we show the utility of social media for rapidly collecting observations of ephemeral ecological phenomena with low spatial and temporal predictability by using a Facebook group dedicated to collecting predation events involving reptiles and amphibians in sub-Saharan Africa. We collected over 1900 independent feeding observations using Facebook from 2015 to 2019 involving 83 families of predators and 129 families of prey. Feeding events by snakes were particularly well-represented with close to 1,100 feeding observations recorded. Relative to an extensive literature review spanning 226 sources and 138 years, we found that social media has provided snake dietary records faster than ever before in history with prey being identified to a finer taxonomic resolution and showing only modest concordance with the literature due to the number of novel interactions that were detected. Finally, we demonstrate that social media can outperform other citizen science image-based approaches (iNaturalist and Google Images) highlighting the versatility of social media and its ability to function as a citizen science platform.", "keywords": ["Citizen science", "Crowd-sourcing", "Facebook", "Feeding interactions", "Herpetofauna", "Natural history", "Snake ecology", "Social media", "Southern Africa", "Trophic ecology"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.7717/peerj.9485"}

The increasingly abundant crowdsourcing data and floating car data provide new support for improving traffic accident management. This paper investigates the methods to predict the complicated behavior of traffic flow evolution after traffic accidents using crowdsourcing data. Based on the available data source, the traffic condition is divided into four levels by congestion delay index: severely congested, congested, slow moving and uncongested. Four types of accidents are consequently defined based on the occurrence of each level. A hierarchical scheme is designed for identifying the most congested level and sequentially predicting duration of each level. The proposed model is validated using traffic accident data in 2017 from an anonymous source in Beijing, China by embedding three machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), in the scheme. The results show NN outperforms the other two models when the assessment is conducted in absolute differences. Meanwhile, RF has a slightly better performance than SVM, especially when predicting the short-period congestion of severely congested level at the first time. By continuously updating the traffic condition information, significant improvement in accuracy can be acquired regardless of the exact model used. This study shows that emerging crowdsourcing data can be used in a real-time analysis of traffic accidents and the proposed model is effective to analyze such data.", "keywords": ["Crowdsourcing data", "Machine learning", "Sequential prediction", "Traffic accidents post-impact"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2020.105696"}

However, with a growing amount of web pages, it is nearly impossible for humans to manually keep track of evolving and continuously changing content in the health domain. To better understand the nature of all web-based health information as given in a specific language, it is important to identify (1) information hubs for the health domain, (2) content providers of high prestige, and (3) important topics and trends in the health-related web. In this context, an automatic web crawling approach can provide the necessary data for a computational and statistical analysis to answer (1) to (3). This study demonstrates the suitability of a focused crawler for the acquisition of the German Health Web (GHW) which includes all health-related web content of the three mostly German speaking countries Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Based on the gathered data, we provide a preliminary analysis of the GHW's graph structure covering its size, most important content providers and a ratio of public to private stakeholders. In addition, we provide our experiences in building and operating such a highly scalable crawler. A support vector machine classifier was trained on a large data set acquired from various German content providers to distinguish between health-related and non-health-related web pages. The classifier was evaluated using accuracy, recall and precision on an 80/20 training/test split (TD1) and against a crowd-validated data set (TD2). To implement the crawler, we extended the open-source framework StormCrawler. The actual crawl was conducted for 227 days. The crawler was evaluated by using harvest rate and its recall was estimated using a seed-target approach. In total, n=22,405 seed URLs with country-code top level domains .de: 85.36% (19,126/22,405), .at: 6.83% (1530/22,405), .ch: 7.81% (1749/22,405), were collected from Curlie and a previous crawl. The text classifier achieved an accuracy on TD1 of 0.937 (TD2=0.966), a precision on TD1 of 0.934 (TD2=0.954) and a recall on TD1 of 0.944 (TD2=0.989). The crawl yields 13.5 million presumably relevant and 119.5 million nonrelevant web pages. The average harvest rate was 19.76%; recall was 0.821 (4105/5000 targets found). The resulting host-aggregated graph contains 215,372 nodes and 403,175 edges (network diameter=25; average path length=6.466; average degree=1.872; average in-degree=1.892; average out-degree=1.845; modularity=0.723). Among the 25 top-ranked pages for each country (according to PageRank), 40% (30/75) were web sites published by public institutions. 25% (19/75) were published by nonprofit organizations and 35% (26/75) by private organizations or individuals. The results indicate, that the presented crawler is a suitable method for acquiring a large fraction of the GHW. As desired, the computed statistical data allows for determining major information hubs and important content providers on the GHW. In the future, the acquired data may be used to assess important topics and trends but also to build health-specific search engines.", "keywords": ["distributed system", "health information", "internet", "web crawling"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.2196/17853"}

Illiteracy and socio-cultural inhibitions may affect the use and utility of this intervention, which has proven beneficial to patients and their families in high income countries (HICs). We aimed to explore how families of ICU patients experienced ICU diaries in our set up by using the Grounded Theory (GT) approach. A relatively new research tool, this enables exploration of a phenomenon to build theories in areas hitherto uncharted. A clinical psychologist did 29 in-depth interviews of relatives of 13 patients admitted in the ICU for >\u200924\u2009h for whom an ICU diary was being maintained. We used a three-step coding process- open, axial, and selective coding, followed by the formulation of a theory embedded in the data. We found that the younger relatives of ICU patients accepted the idea better (age 30, SD 6) Half (48%) had education between 5th to 10th standards. Emergent themes suggested that for the family members, reading and writing the diary brought novelty, acted as a communication enabler, spiritual truss, and improved knowledge leading to change in perspective about the health care system. It also became a bridge to community bonding after patient discharge. Starting with appreciating the novelty of 'diary entries,' which was a new and exciting concept, family members used the diaries to communicate with health care workers (to gain information and understanding about the disease and treatment) and the patient to express their love and to maintain a connection. The diary acted as a confessional for hopes, fears, guilt, and faith for many members. As a tool, it enabled them to understand medical personnel as human beings and to appreciate their efforts, effectively improving confidence in the system. Finally, upon returning home, the diary was a crowd puller for extended family and neighbors encouraging discussions and enhancing bonding and information sharing. Our findings indicate a good acceptance of ICU diaries by family members in our ICU. With less literate, admitted 'shy 'members, in a society where 'diary writing' is not culturally rampant, the appreciation for the novel concept was universal. We see a place for these interventions not only at the patient/ family level but also as a means to 'correct' the image of health care workers in our society by humanizing ourselves to the end-user- the patient and his family.", "keywords": ["Grounded theory", "ICU diary", "India", "LMIC", "Mental health outcomes", "Patients\u2019 families", "Qualitative research"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1186/s41687-020-00229-2"}

Both experiments recruited 40 (20 male and 20 female) pain-free individuals. Overall, results show that pain postures do not capture attention any more than happiness or anger postures, but disengagement from pain postures was significantly slower across both studies. Gender differences were also found, and were more likely to be found when crowds comprised both men and women. Male pain postures were more likely to capture attention.

In this paper we study the emergence of stable clusters of synchrony with complex intercluster dynamics in a three-population network of identical Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. The populations have different sizes and can split into clusters where the oscillators synchronize within a cluster, but notably, there is a phase shift between the dynamics of the clusters. We extend our previous results on the bistability of synchronized clusters in a two-population network [I. V. Belykh et\u00a0al., Chaos 26, 094822 (2016)CHAOEH1054-150010.1063/1.4961435] and demonstrate that the addition of a third population can induce chaotic intercluster dynamics. This effect can be captured by the old adage \"two is company, three is a crowd,\" which suggests that the delicate dynamics of a romantic relationship may be destabilized by the addition of a third party, leading to chaos. Through rigorous analysis and numerics, we demonstrate that the intercluster phase shifts can stably coexist and exhibit different forms of chaotic behavior, including oscillatory, rotatory, and mixed-mode oscillations. We also discuss the implications of our stability results for predicting the emergence of chimeras and solitary states.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.101.062206"}

New treatments, such as catheter-based therapies, require further testing to identify which patients are most likely to experience benefit. At the practice level (T3), translating evidence into practice remains challenging. Areas of overuse and underuse will require evidence-based tools to improve care delivery. At the community and population level (T4), public awareness campaigns need thorough impact assessment.

In the present study, we examined how older adults recruited via MTurk might differ from those recruited via a national probability sample, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), on a battery of outcomes related to health and cognition. Using a Latin-square design, we examined the relationship between recruitment time, remuneration amount, and measures of cognitive functioning. We found substantial differences between our MTurk sample and the participants within the HRS, most notably within measures of verbal fluency and analogical reasoning. Additionally, remuneration amount was related to differences in time to complete recruitment, particularly at the lowest remuneration level, where recruitment completion required between 138 and 485 additional hours. While the general consensus has been that MTurk samples are a reasonable proxy for the larger population, this work suggests that researchers should be wary of overgeneralizing research conducted with older adults recruited through this portal.", "keywords": ["HRS", "MTurk", "cognition", "depression", "feasibility", "online participants"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1177/0091415020940197"}

Simulation results show that our model is reasonable and can better explain the entire contagion process by considering four groups (unsusceptible-susceptible-optimistic-pessimistic) of people. Our theoretical results show: When the pessimists were below the critical value of 0.34, the number of negative emotional groups first increased and then decreased. As the proportion increases, the emotional peak of pessimists increases. The cure probability \u03b8o has the least influence on the P(t), and at the same time, under the action of \u03b8p, the P(t) reaches the stable state first. The increase of the risk coefficient can promote the pessimist infection. When the degree of risk is low, the rate of emotional infection is increased. When the degree of risk is high, the rate of infection is slowed. Therefore, system customizers and related managers can improve the efficiency of stable groups, adjust the proportion of initial negative emotions, control the infection of the spontaneous infection process, and directly deal with negative emotions.

This is commonly attributed to others' eyes being especially salient visual stimuli, but here we ask whether stares-in-the-crowd might arise instead from a deeper property that the eyes (but not only the eyes) signify: the direction of others' attention and intentions. In fact, even simple geometric shapes can be seen as intentional, as when numerous randomly scattered cones are all consistently pointing at you. Accordingly, we show here that cones directed at the observer are detected faster (in fields of averted cones) than are cones averted away from the observer (in fields of directed cones). These results suggest that perceived intentionality itself captures attention-and that even in the absence of eyes, others' directed attention stands out in a crowd.", "keywords": ["direct gaze", "eye contact", "intentionality", "mind contact", "stare in the crowd"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1177/0301006620934320"}

The survey consisted of the Prodromal Questionnaire 16 (PQ-16), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, the Drug Abuse Screening Test 10 and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Regression analyses were performed with the PQ-16 as the dependent variable, and sleep quality as the predictor variable, holding constant sociodemographic variables, depression, and alcohol/drug abuse. 37% of the sample endorsed six or more PQ-16 items, which may be suggestive of an at-risk mental state, with sleep disturbance significantly increasing the likelihood (Odds ratio 2.09\u2009<\u2009.001) of endorsing six or more PQ-16 items. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, depression and drug/alcohol abuse, poor sleep quality made a unique contribution of 5.8% of the variance accounted for in level of distress experienced by attenuated psychotic symptoms.

Data collected by citizen scientists are a valuable resource in many fields of research that require long-term observations at large geographic scales. However, such data may be perceived as less accurate than those collected by trained professionals. Here, we analyze the quality of data from a plant phenology network, which tracks biological response to climate change. We apply five algorithms designed to detect outlier observations or inconsistent observers. These methods rely on different quantitative approaches, including residuals of linear models, correlations among observers, deviations from multivariate clusters, and percentile-based outlier removal. We evaluated these methods by comparing the resulting cleaned datasets in terms of time series means, spatial data coverage, and spatial autocorrelations after outlier removal. Spatial autocorrelations were used to determine the efficacy of outlier removal, as they are expected to increase if outliers and inconsistent observations are successfully removed. All data cleaning methods resulted in better Moran's I autocorrelation statistics, with percentile-based outlier removal and the clustering method showing the greatest improvement. Methods based on residual analysis of linear models had the strongest impact on the final bloom time mean estimates, but were among the weakest based on autocorrelation analysis. Removing entire sets of observations from potentially unreliable observers proved least effective. In conclusion, percentile-based outlier removal emerges as a simple and effective method to improve reliability of citizen science phenology observations.", "keywords": ["Citizen science", "Climate change", "Data cleaning", "Data management", "Outlier detection", "Plant phenology"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s00484-020-01968-z"}

Starting in 2011, a mosquito monitoring programme was therefore launched with adult and immature mosquito stages being collected at numerous sites all over Germany both actively by trapping, netting, aspirating and dipping, and passively by the citizen science project 'Mueckenatlas'. Until the end of 2019, about 516,000 mosquito specimens were analysed, with 52 (probably 53) species belonging to seven genera found, including several species not reported for decades due to being extremely rare (Aedes refiki, Anopheles algeriensis, Culex martinii) or local (Culiseta alaskaensis, Cs. glaphyroptera, Cs. ochroptera). In addition to 43 (probably 44 including Cs. subochrea) out of 46 species previously described for Germany, nine species were collected that had never been documented before. These consisted of five species recently established (Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus, Ae. koreicus, An. petragnani, Cs. longiareolata), three species probably introduced on one single occasion only and not established (Ae. aegypti, Ae. berlandi, Ae. pulcritarsis), and a newly described cryptic species of the Anopheles maculipennis complex (An. daciae) that had probably always been present but not been differentiated from its siblings. Two species formerly listed for Germany could not be documented (Ae. cyprius, Ae. nigrinus), while presence is likely for another species (Cs. subochrea), which could not be demonstrated in the monitoring programme as it can neither morphologically nor genetically be reliably distinguished from a closely related species (Cs. annulata) in the female sex. While Cs. annulata males were collected in the present programme, this was not the case with Cs. subochrea. In summary, although some species regarded endemic could not be found during the last 9\u00a0years, the number of culicid species that must be considered firmly established in Germany has increased to 51 (assuming Cs. subochrea and Ae. nigrinus are still present) due to several newly emerged ones but also to one species (Ae. cyprius) that must be considered extinct after almost a century without documentation. Most likely, introduction and establishment of the new species are a consequence of globalisation and climate warming, as three of them are native to Asia (Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus, Ae. koreicus) and three (Ae. albopictus, An. petragnani, Cs. longiareolata) are relatively thermophilic. Another thermophilic species, Uranotaenia unguiculata, which had been described for southwestern Germany in 1994 and had since been found only at the very site of its first detection, was recently documented at additional localities in the northeastern part of the country. As several mosquito species found in Germany are serious pests or potential vectors of disease agents and should be kept under permanent observation or even be controlled immediately on emergence, the German mosquito monitoring programme has recently been institutionalised and perpetuated.", "keywords": ["Climate warming", "Culicidae", "Germany", "Globalisation", "Invasive species", "Inventory", "Mosquito monitoring"], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/s00436-020-06775-4"}

We propose a novel measurement method based on a deep neural architecture that we train on the basis of generic physical properties of the motion of pedestrians. Specifically, we leverage on the strong statistical correlation between individual velocity and body orientation: the velocity direction is typically orthogonal with respect to the shoulder line. We make the reasonable assumption that this approximation, although instantaneously slightly imperfect, is correct on average. This enables us to use velocity data as training labels for a highly-accurate point-estimator of individual orientation, that we can train with no dedicated annotation labor. We discuss the measurement accuracy and show the error scaling, both on synthetic and real-life data: we show that our method is capable of estimating orientation with an error as low as [Formula: see text]. This tool opens up new possibilities in the studies of human crowd dynamics where orientation is key. By analyzing the dynamics of body rotation in real-life conditions, we show that the instantaneous velocity direction can be described by the combination of orientation and a random delay, where randomness is provided by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process centered on an average delay of [Formula: see text]. Quantifying these dynamics could have only been possible thanks to a tool as precise as that proposed.", "keywords": [], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-68287-6"}
